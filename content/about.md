I am Vincent, and I am finishing a PhD at the [Physico-Chimie Curie lab](https://science.institut-curie.org/research/multiscale-physics-biology-chemistry/umr168-physical-chemistry/) on causal graph reconstruction from observational data of biological or clinical nature under the supervision of Herv√© Isambert.

During my thesis, I worked on an information-theoretic constraint-based approach to infer causality from mixed data of any type, to be able to deal with heterogeneous real-life datasets like eletronic medical records ([1](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007866&rev=2)).

I also contributed with my colleagues to make this class of algorithms more interpretable and more reliable ([2](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2019/hash/e6872f5bbe75073f8c7cfb93de7f6f3a-Abstract.html), [3](https://why21.causalai.net/papers/WHY21_24.pdf)).

My research interests are Causal Graphs and Causal Inference, Information Theory, and mostly everything that uses conditional independence testing.
