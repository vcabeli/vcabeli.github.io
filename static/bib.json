    "abstract": "During haematopoiesis, haematopoietic stem cells differentiate into restricted potential progenitors before maturing into the many lineages required for oxygen transport, wound healing and immune response. We have updated Haemopedia, a database of gene-expression profiles from a broad spectrum of haematopoietic cells, to include RNA-seq gene-expression data from both mice and humans. The Haemopedia RNA-seq data set covers a wide range of lineages and progenitors, with 57 mouse blood cell types (flow sorted populations from healthy mice) and 12 human blood cell types. This data set has been made accessible for exploration and analysis, to researchers and clinicians with limited bioinformatics experience, on our online portal Haemosphere: https://www.haemosphere.org. Haemosphere also includes nine other publicly available high-quality data sets relevant to haematopoiesis. We have added the ability to compare gene expression across data sets and species by curating data sets with shared lineage designations or to view expression gene vs gene, with all plots available for download by the user.",

    "abstract": "A goal of single cell genome-wide profiling is to reconstruct dynamic transitions during cell differentiation, disease onset, and drug response. Single cell assays have recently been integrated with lineage tracing, a set of methods that identify cells of common ancestry to establish bona fide dynamic relationships between cell states. These integrated methods have revealed unappreciated cell dynamics, but their analysis faces recurrent challenges arising from noisy, dispersed lineage data. Here, we develop coherent, sparse optimization (CoSpar) as a robust computational approach to infer cell dynamics from single-cell genomics integrated with lineage tracing. CoSpar is robust to severe down-sampling and dispersion of lineage data, which enables simpler, lower-cost experimental designs and requires less calibration. In datasets representing hematopoiesis, reprogramming, and directed differentiation, CoSpar identifies fate biases not previously detected, predicting transcription factors and receptors implicated in fate choice. Documentation and detailed examples for common experimental designs are available at https://cospar.readthedocs.io/.",

    "abstract": "The cardinal property of bone marrow (BM) stromal cells is their capacity to contribute to hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niches by providing mediators assisting HSC functions. In this study we first contrasted transcriptomes of stromal cells at different developmental stages and then included large number of HSC-supportive and non-supportive samples. Application of a combination of algorithms, comprising one identifying reliable paths and potential causative relationships in complex systems, revealed gene networks characteristic of the BM stromal HSC-supportive capacity and of defined niche populations of perivascular cells, osteoblasts, and mesenchymal stromal cells. Inclusion of single-cell transcriptomes enabled establishing for the perivascular cell subset a partially oriented graph of direct gene-to-gene interactions. As proof of concept we showed that R-spondin-2, expressed by the perivascular subset, synergized with Kit ligand to amplify ex vivo hematopoietic precursors. This study by identifying classifiers and hubs constitutes a resource to unravel candidate BM stromal mediators.",

    "abstract": "For estimating causal effects of treatments, randomized experiments are generally considered the gold standard. Nevertheless, they are often infeasible to conduct for a variety of reasons, such as ethical concerns, excessive expense, or timeliness. Consequently, much of our knowledge of causal effects must come from non-randomized observational studies. This article will advocate the position that observational studies can and should be designed to approximate randomized experiments as closely as possible. In particular, observational studies should be designed using only background information to create subgroups of similar treated and control units, where ‘similar’ here refers to their distributions of background variables. Of great importance, this activity should be conducted without any access to any outcome data, thereby assuring the objectivity of the design. In many situations, this objective creation of subgroups of similar treated and control units, which are balanced with respect to covariates, can be accomplished using propensity score methods. The theoretical perspective underlying this position will be presented followed by a particular application in the context of the US tobacco litigation. This application uses propensity score methods to create subgroups of treated units (male current smokers) and control units (male never smokers) who are at least as similar with respect to their distributions of observed background characteristics as if they had been randomized. The collection of these subgroups then ‘approximate’ a randomized block experiment with respect to the observed covariates. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

    "abstract": "The propensity score is the conditional probability of assignment to a particular treatment given a vector of observed covariates. Both large and small sample theory show that adjustment for the scalar propensity score is sufficient to remove bias due to all observed covariates. Applications include: (i) matched sampling on the univariate propensity score, which is a generalization of discriminant matching, (ii) multivariate adjustment by subclassification on the propensity score where the same subclasses are used to estimate treatment effects for all outcome variables and in all subpopulations, and (iii) visual representation of multivariate covariance adjustment by a two- dimensional plot.",

    "abstract": "Population stratification—allele frequency differences between cases and controls due to systematic ancestry differences—can cause spurious associations in disease studies. We describe a method that enables explicit detection and correction of population stratification on a genome-wide scale. Our method uses principal components analysis to explicitly model ancestry differences between cases and controls. The resulting correction is specific to a candidate marker’s variation in frequency across ancestral populations, minimizing spurious associations while maximizing power to detect true associations. Our simple, efficient approach can easily be applied to disease studies with hundreds of thousands of markers.",

    "abstract": "The observed features of a given phenomenon are not all equally informative: some may be noisy, others correlated or irrelevant. The purpose of feature selection is to select a set of features pertinent to a given task. This is a complex process, but it is an important issue in many fields. In neural networks, feature selection has been studied for the last ten years, using conventional and original methods. This paper is a review of neural network approaches to feature selection. We first briefly introduce baseline statistical methods used in regression and classification. We then describe families of methods which have been developed specifically for neural networks. Representative methods are then compared on different test problems.",

    "abstract": "Many real datasets contain values missing not at random (MNAR). In this scenario, investigators often perform list-wise deletion, or delete samples with any missing values, before applying causal discovery algorithms. List-wise deletion is a sound and general strategy when paired with algorithms such as FCI and RFCI, but the deletion procedure also eliminates otherwise good samples that contain only a few missing values. In this report, we show that we can more efficiently utilize the observed values with test-wise deletion while still maintaining algorithmic soundness. Here, test-wise deletion refers to the process of list-wise deleting samples only among the variables required for each conditional independence (CI) test used in constraint-based searches. Test-wise deletion therefore often saves more samples than list-wise deletion for each CI test, especially when we have a sparse underlying graph. Our theoretical results show that test-wise deletion is sound under the justifiable assumption that none of the missingness mechanisms causally affect each other in the underlying causal graph. We also find that FCI and RFCI with test-wise deletion outperform their list-wise deletion and imputation counterparts on average when MNAR holds in both synthetic and real data.",

    "abstract": "This paper shows how recent Bayesian network (BN) algorithms can be used to model time to failure distributions and perform reliability analysis of complex systems in a simple unified way. The algorithms work for so-called hybrid BNs, which are BNs that can contain a mixture of both discrete and continuous variables. Our BN approach extends fault trees by defining the time-to-failure of the fault tree constructs as deterministic functions of the corresponding input components’ time-to-failure. This helps solve any configuration of static and dynamic gates with general time-to-failure distributions. Unlike other approaches (which tend to be restricted to using exponential failure distributions) our approach can use any parametric or empirical distribution for the time-to-failure of the system components. We demonstrate that the approach produces results equivalent to the state of the practice and art for small examples; more importantly our approach produces solutions hitherto unobtainable for more complex examples, involving non-standard assumptions.. The approach offers a powerful framework for analysts and decision makers to successfully perform robust reliability assessment. Sensitivity, uncertainty, diagnosis analysis, common cause failures and warranty analysis can also be easily performed within this framework.",

    "abstract": "We consider approximate inference in hybrid Bayesian Networks (BNs) and present a new iterative algorithm that efficiently combines dynamic discretization with robust propagation algorithms on junction trees. Our approach offers a significant extension to Bayesian Network theory and practice by offering a flexible way of modeling continuous nodes in BNs conditioned on complex configurations of evidence and intermixed with discrete nodes as both parents and children of continuous nodes. Our algorithm is implemented in a commercial Bayesian Network software package, AgenaRisk, which allows model construction and testing to be carried out easily. The results from the empirical trials clearly show how our software can deal effectively with different type of hybrid models containing elements of expert judgment as well as statistical inference. In particular, we show how the rapid convergence of the algorithm towards zones of high probability density, make robust inference analysis possible even in situations where, due to the lack of information in both prior and data, robust sampling becomes unfeasible.",

    "abstract": "We derive the mean squared error convergence rates of kernel density-based plug-in estimators of mutual information measures between two multidimensional random variables X and Y for two cases: 1) X and Y are both continuous; 2) X is continuous and Y is discrete. Using the derived rates, we propose an ensemble estimator of these information measures for the second case by taking a weighted sum of the plug-in estimators with varied bandwidths. The resulting ensemble estimator achieves the 1 /N parametric convergence rate when the conditional densities of the continuous variables are sufficiently smooth. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first nonparametric mutual information estimator known to achieve the parametric convergence rate for this case, which frequently arises in applications (e.g. variable selection in classification). The estimator is simple to implement as it uses the solution to an offline convex optimization problem and simple plug-in estimators. Ensemble estimators that achieve the parametric rate are also derived for the first case (X and Y are both continuous) and another case: 3) X and Y may have any mixture of discrete and continuous components.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel estimator of mutual information for discrete and continuous variables. The main feature of this estimator is that it is zero for a large sample size n if and only if the two variables are independent. The estimator can be used to construct several histograms, compute estimations of mutual information, and choose the maximum value. We prove that the number of histograms constructed has an upper bound of O(log n) and apply this fact to the search. We compare the performance of the proposed estimator with an estimator of the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC), though the proposed method is based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle and the HSIC provides a statistical test. The proposed method completes the estimation in O(n log n) time, whereas the HSIC kernel computation requires O(n3) time. We also present examples in which the HSIC fails to detect independence but the proposed method successfully detects it.",

    "abstract": "Modelling causal relationships has become popular across various disciplines. Most common frameworks for causality are the Pearlian causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and the Neyman-Rubin potential outcome framework. In this paper, we propose an information theoretic framework for causal effect quantification. To this end, we formulate a two step causal deduction procedure in the Pearl and Rubin frameworks and introduce its equivalent which uses information theoretic terms only. The first step of the procedure consists of ensuring no confounding or finding an adjustment set with directed information. In the second step, the causal effect is quantified. We subsequently unify previous definitions of directed information present in the literature and clarify the confusion surrounding them. We also motivate using chain graphs for directed information in time series and extend our approach to chain graphs. The proposed approach serves as a translation between causality modelling and information theory.",

    "abstract": "Much of the recent work on the epistemology of causation has centered on two assumptions, known as the Causal Markov Condition and the Causal Faithfulness Condition. Philosophical discussions of the latter condition have exhibited situations in which it is likely to fail. This paper studies the Causal Faithfulness Condition as a conjunction of weaker conditions. We show that some of the weaker conjuncts can be empirically tested, and hence do not have to be assumed a priori. Our results lead to two methodologically significant observations: (1) some common types of counterexamples to the Faithfulness condition constitute objections only to the empirically testable part of the condition; and (2) some common defenses of the Faithfulness condition do not provide justification or evidence for the testable parts of the condition. It is thus worthwhile to study the possibility of reliable causal inference under weaker Faithfulness conditions. As it turns out, the modification needed to make standard procedures work under a weaker version of the Faithfulness condition also has the practical effect of making them more robust when the standard Faithfulness condition actually holds. This, we argue, is related to the possibility of controlling error probabilities with finite sample size (“uniform consistency”) in causal inference.",

    "abstract": "The Mutual Information (MI) is an often used measure of dependency between two random variables utilized in information theory, statistics and machine learning. Recently several MI estimators have been proposed that can achieve parametric MSE convergence rate. However, most of the previously proposed estimators have the high computational complexity of at least \\$O(N\\^2)\\$. We propose a unified method for empirical non-parametric estimation of general MI function between random vectors in \\$\\\\mathbb{R}\\^d\\$ based on \\$N\\$ i.i.d. samples. The reduced complexity MI estimator, called the ensemble dependency graph estimator (EDGE), combines randomized locality sensitive hashing (LSH), dependency graphs, and ensemble bias-reduction methods. We prove that EDGE achieves optimal computational complexity \\$O(N)\\$, and can achieve the optimal parametric MSE rate of \\$O(1/N)\\$ if the density is \\$d\\$ times differentiable. To the best of our knowledge EDGE is the first non-parametric MI estimator that can achieve parametric MSE rates with linear time complexity. We illustrate the utility of EDGE for the analysis of the information plane (IP) in deep learning. Using EDGE we shed light on a controversy on whether or not the compression property of information bottleneck (IB) in fact holds for ReLu and other rectification functions in deep neural networks (DNN).",

    "abstract": "Despite their great success, there is still no comprehensive theoretical understanding of learning with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) or their inner organization. Previous work proposed to analyze DNNs in the \\\\textit{Information Plane}; i.e., the plane of the Mutual Information values that each layer preserves on the input and output variables. They suggested that the goal of the network is to optimize the Information Bottleneck (IB) tradeoff between compression and prediction, successively, for each layer. In this work we follow up on this idea and demonstrate the effectiveness of the Information-Plane visualization of DNNs. Our main results are: (i) most of the training epochs in standard DL are spent on {\\\\emph compression} of the input to efficient representation and not on fitting the training labels. (ii) The representation compression phase begins when the training errors becomes small and the Stochastic Gradient Decent (SGD) epochs change from a fast drift to smaller training error into a stochastic relaxation, or random diffusion, constrained by the training error value. (iii) The converged layers lie on or very close to the Information Bottleneck (IB) theoretical bound, and the maps from the input to any hidden layer and from this hidden layer to the output satisfy the IB self-consistent equations. This generalization through noise mechanism is unique to Deep Neural Networks and absent in one layer networks. (iv) The training time is dramatically reduced when adding more hidden layers. Thus the main advantage of the hidden layers is computational. This can be explained by the reduced relaxation time, as this it scales super-linearly (exponentially for simple diffusion) with the information compression from the previous layer.",

    "abstract": "We review the current literature concerned with information plane analyses of neural network classifiers. While the underlying information bottleneck theory and the claim that information-theoretic compression is causally linked to generalization are plausible, empirical evidence was found to be both supporting and conflicting. We review this evidence together with a detailed analysis of how the respective information quantities were estimated. Our survey suggests that compression visualized in information planes is not necessarily information-theoretic, but is rather often compatible with geometric compression of the latent representations. This insight gives the information plane a renewed justification. Aside from this, we shed light on the problem of estimating mutual information in deterministic neural networks and its consequences. Specifically, we argue that even in feed-forward neural networks the data processing inequality need not hold for estimates of mutual information. Similarly, while a fitting phase, in which the mutual information between the latent representation and the target increases, is necessary (but not sufficient) for good classification performance, depending on the specifics of mutual information estimation such a fitting phase need not be visible in the information plane.",

Focusing on feedforward networks with fixed weights and noisy internal representations, we develop a rigorous framework for accurate estimation of I(X;T\\_ℓℓ\\\\ell). By relating I(X;T\\_ℓℓ\\\\ell) to information transmission over additive white Gaussian noise channels, we reveal that compression, i.e. reduction in I(X;T\\_ℓℓ\\\\ell) over the course of training, is driven by progressive geometric clustering of the representations of samples from the same class. Experimental results verify this connection. Finally, we shift focus to purely deterministic DNNs, where I(X;T\\_ℓℓ\\\\ell) is provably vacuous, and show that nevertheless, these models also cluster inputs belonging to the same class. The binning-based approximation of I(X;T\\_ℓℓ\\\\ell) employed in past works to measure compression is identified as a measure of clustering, thus clarifying that these experiments were in fact tracking the same clustering phenomenon. Leveraging the clustering perspective, we provide new evidence that compression and generalization may not be causally related and discuss potential future research ideas.",

Examples include the information that face images provide about the names of the people portrayed, or the information that speech sounds provide about the words spoken. Understanding the signal \\$x\\$ requires more than just predicting \\$y\\$, it also requires specifying which features of \\$\\\\X\\$ play a role in the prediction. We formalize this problem as that of finding a short code for \\$\\\\X\\$ that preserves the maximum information about \\$\\\\Y\\$. That is, we squeeze the information that \\$\\\\X\\$ provides about \\$\\\\Y\\$ through a ‘bottleneck’ formed by a limited set of codewords \\$\\\\tX\\$. This constrained optimization problem can be seen as a generalization of rate distortion theory in which the distortion measure \\$d(x,\\\\x)\\$ emerges from the joint statistics of \\$\\\\X\\$ and \\$\\\\Y\\$. This approach yields an exact set of self consistent equations for the coding rules \\$X \\\\to \\\\tX\\$ and \\$\\\\tX \\\\to \\\\Y\\$. Solutions to these equations can be found by a convergent re-estimation method that generalizes the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm. Our variational principle provides a surprisingly rich framework for discussing a variety of problems in signal processing and learning, as will be described in detail elsewhere.",

The estimators are calculated as the sum of \\$p\\$-th powers of the Euclidean lengths of the edges of the ‘generalized nearest-neighbor’ graph of the sample and the empirical copula of the sample respectively. For the first time, we prove the almost sure consistency of these estimators and upper bounds on their rates of convergence, the latter of which under the assumption that the density underlying the sample is Lipschitz continuous. Experiments demonstrate their usefulness in independent subspace analysis.",

    "abstract": "Estimating conditional mutual information (CMI) is an essential yet challenging step in many machine learning and data mining tasks. Estimating CMI from data that contains both discrete and continuous variables, or even discrete-continuous mixture variables, is a particularly hard problem. In this paper, we show that CMI for such mixture variables, defined based on the Radon-Nikodym derivate, can be written as a sum of entropies, just like CMI for purely discrete or continuous data. Further, we show that CMI can be consistently estimated for discrete-continuous mixture variables by learning an adaptive histogram model. In practice, we estimate such a model by iteratively discretizing the continuous data points in the mixture variables. To evaluate the performance of our estimator, we benchmark it against state-of-the-art CMI estimators as well as evaluate it in a causal discovery setting.",

    "abstract": "Estimating mutual information from i.i.d. samples drawn from an unknown joint density function is a basic statistical problem of broad interest with multitudinous applications. The most popular estimator is one proposed by Kraskov and St\\\\\"ogbauer and Grassberger (KSG) in 2004, and is nonparametric and based on the distances of each sample to its \\$k\\^{\\\\rm th}\\$ nearest neighboring sample, where \\$k\\$ is a fixed small integer. Despite its widespread use (part of scientific software packages), theoretical properties of this estimator have been largely unexplored. In this paper we demonstrate that the estimator is consistent and also identify an upper bound on the rate of convergence of the bias as a function of number of samples. We argue that the superior performance benefits of the KSG estimator stems from a curious \"correlation boosting\" effect and build on this intuition to modify the KSG estimator in novel ways to construct a superior estimator. As a byproduct of our investigations, we obtain nearly tight rates of convergence of the \\$\\\\ell\\_2\\$ error of the well known fixed \\$k\\$ nearest neighbor estimator of differential entropy by Kozachenko and Leonenko.",

The coefficient has a long list of desirable properties, the most important of which is that under absolutely no distributional assumptions, it converges to a limit in \\$[0,1]\\$, where the limit is \\$0\\$ if and only if \\$Y\\$ and \\$Z\\$ are conditionally independent given \\$X\\_1,\\\\ldots,X\\_p\\$, and is \\$1\\$ if and only if \\$Y\\$ is equal to a measurable function of \\$Z\\$ given \\$X\\_1,\\\\ldots,X\\_p\\$. Moreover, it has a natural interpretation as a nonlinear generalization of the familiar partial \\$R\\^2\\$ statistic for measuring conditional dependence by regression. Using this statistic, we devise a new variable selection algorithm, called Feature Ordering by Conditional Independence (FOCI), which is model-free, has no tuning parameters, and is provably consistent under sparsity assumptions. A number of applications to synthetic and real datasets are worked out.",

    "abstract": "It is a common saying that testing for conditional independence, i.e., testing whether whether two random vectors \\$X\\$ and \\$Y\\$ are independent, given \\$Z\\$, is a hard statistical problem if \\$Z\\$ is a continuous random variable (or vector). In this paper, we prove that conditional independence is indeed a particularly difficult hypothesis to test for. Valid statistical tests are required to have a size that is smaller than a predefined significance level, and different tests usually have power against a different class of alternatives. We prove that a valid test for conditional independence does not have power against any alternative. Given the non-existence of a uniformly valid conditional independence test, we argue that tests must be designed so their suitability for a particular problem may be judged easily. To address this need, we propose in the case where \\$X\\$ and \\$Y\\$ are univariate to nonlinearly regress \\$X\\$ on \\$Z\\$, and \\$Y\\$ on \\$Z\\$ and then compute a test statistic based on the sample covariance between the residuals, which we call the generalised covariance measure (GCM). We prove that validity of this form of test relies almost entirely on the weak requirement that the regression procedures are able to estimate the conditional means \\$X\\$ given \\$Z\\$, and \\$Y\\$ given \\$Z\\$, at a slow rate. We extend the methodology to handle settings where \\$X\\$ and \\$Y\\$ may be multivariate or even high-dimensional. While our general procedure can be tailored to the setting at hand by combining it with any regression technique, we develop the theoretical guarantees for kernel ridge regression. A simulation study shows that the test based on GCM is competitive with state of the art conditional independence tests. Code is available as the R package GeneralisedCovarianceMeasure on CRAN.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a low bias histogram-based estimation of mutual information and its application to feature selection problems. By canceling the first order bias, the estimation avoids the bias accumulation problem that affects classical methods. As a consequence, on a synthetic feature selection problem, only the proposed method results in the exact number of features to be chosen in the Gaussian case when compared to four other approaches. In a speech recognition application, the proposed method and the Sturges method are the only ones that lead to a correct number of selected features in the noise free case. In the reduced data case, only the proposed method points out the optimal number of features to select. Finally, in the noisy case, only the proposed method leads to results of high quality; other methods show severely underestimated numbers of selected features.",

    "abstract": "Histograms have extensively been used as a simple tool for nonparametric probability density function estimation. However, practically, the accuracy of some histogram-based derived quantities, such as the marginal entropy (ME), the joint entropy (JE), or the mutual information (MI) depends on the number of bins chosen for the histogram. In this paper, we investigate the binning problem of bi-histogram for the estimation of JE. By minimizing a theoretical mean square error (MSE) of JE estimation, we derive a new formula for the optimal number of bins of bi-histogram for continuous random variables. This novel JE estimation has been used in the MI estimation to avoid the error accumulation of joint MI between the class variable and feature subset in the feature selection. In a synthetic Gaussian feature selection problem, only the proposed method permits to retrieve the exact number of relevant features that explain the class variable when compared to a concurrent univariate estimator based on binning formula that has been proposed for ME estimation. In speech and speaker recognition applications, the proposed method permits to select a limited number of features which guaranties approximately the same or an even better recognition rate than using the total number of features.",

    "abstract": "Causal network reconstruction from time series is an emerging topic in many fields of science. Beyond inferring directionality between two time series, the goal of causal network reconstruction or causal discovery is to distinguish direct from indirect dependencies and common drivers among multiple time series. Here, the problem of inferring causal networks including time lags from multivariate time series is recapitulated from the underlying causal assumptions to practical estimation problems. Each aspect is illustrated with simple examples including unobserved variables, sampling issues, determinism, stationarity, nonlinearity, measurement error, and significance testing. The effects of dynamical noise, autocorrelation, and high dimensionality are highlighted in comparison studies of common causal reconstruction methods. Finally, method performance evaluation approaches and criteria are suggested. The article is intended to briefly review and accessibly illustrate the foundations and practical problems of time series-based causal discovery and stimulate further methodological developments.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental task in various disciplines of science, including biology, is to find underlying causal relations and make use of them. Causal relations can be seen if interventions are properly applied; however, in many cases they are difficult or even impossible to conduct. It is then necessary to discover causal relations by analyzing statistical properties of purely observational data, which is known as causal discovery or causal structure search. This paper aims to give a introduction to and a brief review of the computational methods for causal discovery that were developed in the past three decades, including constraint-based and score-based methods and those based on functional causal models, supplemented by some illustrations and applications.",

We then show how this measure relates to an entropy reduction principle that can be seen as a special case of the Probabilistic Raising Principle. We finally combine these two ingredients in a PC-like algorithm to construct the summary causal graph. This algorithm is evaluated on several datasets that shows both its efficacy and efficiency.",

    "abstract": "In classical causal inference, inferring cause-effect relations from data relies on the assumption that units are independent and identically distributed. This assumption is violated in settings where units are related through a network of dependencies. An example of such a setting is ad placement in sponsored search advertising, where the clickability of a particular ad is potentially influenced by where it is placed and where other ads are placed on the search result page. In such scenarios, confounding arises due to not only the individual ad-level covariates but also the placements and covariates of other ads in the system. In this paper, we leverage the language of causal inference in the presence of interference to model interactions among the ads. Quantification of such interactions allows us to better understand the click behavior of users, which in turn impacts the revenue of the host search engine and enhances user satisfaction. We illustrate the utility of our formalization through experiments carried out on the ad placement system of the Bing search engine.",

    "abstract": "This paper re-examines a continuous optimization framework dubbed NOTEARS for learning Bayesian networks. We first generalize existing algebraic characterizations of acyclicity to a class of matrix polynomials. Next, focusing on a one-parameter-per-edge setting, it is shown that the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions for the NOTEARS formulation cannot be satisfied except in a trivial case, which explains a behavior of the associated algorithm. We then derive the KKT conditions for an equivalent reformulation, show that they are indeed necessary, and relate them to explicit constraints that certain edges be absent from the graph. If the score function is convex, these KKT conditions are also sufficient for local minimality despite the non-convexity of the constraint. Informed by the KKT conditions, a local search post-processing algorithm is proposed and shown to substantially and universally improve the structural Hamming distance of all tested algorithms, typically by a factor of 2 or more. Some combinations with local search are both more accurate and more efficient than the original NOTEARS.",

    "abstract": "The heart of the scientific enterprise is a rational effort to understand the causes behind the phenomena we observe. In large-scale complex dynamical systems such as the Earth system, real experiments are rarely feasible. However, a rapidly increasing amount of observational and simulated data opens up the use of novel data-driven causal methods beyond the commonly adopted correlation techniques. Here, we give an overview of causal inference frameworks and identify promising generic application cases common in Earth system sciences and beyond. We discuss challenges and initiate the benchmark platform causeme.netto close the gap between method users and developers.",

    "abstract": "Mapping cell fate during hematopoiesis Biologists have long attempted to understand how stem and progenitor cells in regenerating and embryonic tissues differentiate into mature cell types. Through the use of recent technical advances to sequence the genes expressed in thousands of individual cells, differentiation mechanisms are being revealed. Weinreb et al. extended these methods to track clones of cells (cell families) across time. Their approach reveals differences in cellular gene expression as cells progress through hematopoiesis, which is the process of blood production. Using machine learning, they tested how well gene expression measurements account for the choices that cells make. This work reveals that a considerable gap still exists in understanding differentiation mechanisms, and future methods are needed to fully understand—and ultimately control—cell differentiation. Science, this issue p. eaaw3381 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONDuring tissue turnover, stem and progenitor cells differentiate to produce mature cell types. To understand and ultimately control differentiation, it is important to establish how initial differences between cells influence their ultimate choice of cell fate. This challenge is exemplified in hematopoiesis, the ongoing process of blood regeneration in bone marrow, in which multipotent progenitors give rise to red cells of the blood, as well as myeloid and lymphoid immune cell types.In hematopoiesis, progenitor cell states have been canonically defined by their expression of several antigens. However, as in several other tissues, recent transcriptome analysis by single-cell RNA sequencing (scSeq) showed that the canonically defined intermediate cell types are not uniform, but rather contain cells in a variety of gene expression states. scSeq also showed that the states of hematopoietic progenitors form a continuum, differing from classic depictions of a discrete stepwise hierarchy. RATIONALEIn this study, we set out to establish how variation in transcriptional state biases future cell fate and whether scSeq is sufficient to completely distinguish cells with distinct fate biases. Directly linking whole-transcriptome descriptions of cells to their future fate is challenging because cells are destroyed during scSeq measurement. We therefore developed a tool we call LARRY (lineage and RNA recovery) that clonally tags cells with DNA barcodes that can be read using scSeq. Using LARRY, we aimed to reconstruct the genome-wide transcriptional trajectories of cells as they differentiate. RESULTSWe linked transcriptional progenitor states with their clonal fates by barcoding heterogeneous cells, allowing cell division, and then sampling cells for scSeq immediately or at later time points after differentiation in culture or in transplanted mice. We profiled \\>300,000 cells in total, comprising 10,968 clones that gave information on lineage relationships at single time points and 2632 clones spanning multiple time points in culture or in mice. We confirmed that clonal trajectories over time approximated the trajectories of single cells and were thus able to identify states of primed fate potential on the continuous transcriptional landscape. From this analysis, we identified genes correlating with fate, established a lineage hierarchy for hematopoiesis in culture and after transplantation, and revealed two routes of monocyte differentiation that give rise to distinct gene expression programs in mature cells. The data made it possible to test state-of the-art algorithms of scSeq analysis, and we found that fate choice occurs earlier than predicted algorithmically but that computationally predicted pseudotime orderings faithfully describe clonal dynamics.We investigated whether there are stable cellular properties that have a cell-autonomous influence on fate choice yet are not detected by scSeq. By analyzing clones split between wells or transplanted into separate mice, we found that the variance in cell fate choice attributable to cell-autonomous fate bias was greater than what could be explained by initial transcriptional state. Less formally, sister cells tended to be far more similar in their fate choice than pairs of cells with similar transcriptomes. These results suggest that current scSeq measurements cannot fully separate progenitor cells with distinct fate bias. The missing signature of future fate choice might be detectable in the RNA that is not sampled during scSeq. Alternatively, other stable cellular properties such as chromatin state could encode the missing information. CONCLUSIONBy integrating transcriptome and lineage measurements, we established a map of clonal fate on a continuous transcriptional landscape. The map revealed transcriptional correlates of fate among putatively multipotent cells, convergent differentiation trajectories, and fate boundaries that could be not be predicted using current trajectory inference methods. However, the map is far from complete because scSeq cannot separate cells with distinct fate bias. Our results argue for looking beyond scSeq to define cellular maps of stem and progenitor cells and offer an approach for linking cell state and fate in other tissues. \\<img class=\"fragment-image\" aria-describedby=\"F1-caption\" src=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/367/6479/eaaw3381/F1.medium.gif\"/\\> Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Lineage and transcriptome measurements allow fate mapping on continuous cell state landscapes.A tool we named LARRY labels cell clones with an scSeq-compatible barcode. By barcoding cells, letting them divide, and then sampling them immediately or after differentiation, it is possible to link the initial states of cells with their differentiation outcomes and produce a map of cell fate bias on a continuous transcriptional landscape. A challenge in biology is to associate molecular differences among progenitor cells with their capacity to generate mature cell types. Here, we used expressed DNA barcodes to clonally trace transcriptomes over time and applied this to study fate determination in hematopoiesis. We identified states of primed fate potential and located them on a continuous transcriptional landscape. We identified two routes of monocyte differentiation that leave an imprint on mature cells. Analysis of sister cells also revealed cells to have intrinsic fate biases not detectable by single-cell RNA sequencing. Finally, we benchmarked computational methods of dynamic inference from single-cell snapshots, showing that fate choice occurs earlier than is detected by state-of the-art algorithms and that cells progress steadily through pseudotime with precise and consistent dynamics. Single-cell barcoding allows the tracking of gene expression states over time as blood cells differentiate during hematopoiesis.

    "abstract": "Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) maintain the adult blood system, and their dysregulation causes a multitude of diseases. However, the differentiation journeys toward specific hematopoietic lineages remain ill defined, and system-wide disease interpretation remains challenging. Here, we have profiled 44 802 mouse bone marrow HSPCs using single-cell RNA sequencing to provide a comprehensive transcriptional landscape with entry points to 8 different blood lineages (lymphoid, megakaryocyte, erythroid, neutrophil, monocyte, eosinophil, mast cell, and basophil progenitors). We identified a common basophil/mast cell bone marrow progenitor and characterized its molecular profile at the single-cell level. Transcriptional profiling of 13 815 HSPCs from the c-Kit mutant (W41/W41) mouse model revealed the absence of a distinct mast cell lineage entry point, together with global shifts in cell type abundance. Proliferative defects were accompanied by reduced Myc expression. Potential compensatory processes included upregulation of the integrated stress response pathway and downregulation of proapoptotic gene expression in erythroid progenitors, thus providing a template of how large-scale single-cell transcriptomic studies can bridge between molecular phenotypes and quantitative population changes.",

    "abstract": "The performance of constraint-based causal discovery algorithms is prominently determined by the performance of the (conditional) independence tests that are being used. A default choice for the (conditional) independence test is the (partial) correlation test, which can fail in presence of nonlinear relations between the variables. Recent research proposes a Bayesian nonparametric two-sample test (Holmes et al., 2015), an independence test between continuous variables (Filippi and Holmes, 2017), and a conditional independence test between continuous variables (Teymur and Filippi, 2019). We extend this work by proposing a novel Bayesian nonparametric conditional two-sample test. We utilise this conditional two-sample test for testing the conditional independence \\$C \\\\perp \\\\!\\\\!\\\\! \\\\perp Y X\\$ where C denotes a Bernoulli random variable, and X and Y are continuous one-dimensional random variables. This enables a nonparametric implementation of the Local Causal Discovery (LCD) algorithm with binary variables in the experimental setup (e.g. an indicator of treatment/control group). We propose a fair performance measure for comparing frequentist and Bayesian tests in the LCD setting. We utilise this performance measure for comparing our Bayesian ensemble with state-of-the-art frequentist tests, and conclude that the Bayesian ensemble has better performance than its frequentist counterparts. We apply our nonparametric implementation of the LCD algorithm to protein expression data.",

    "abstract": "Doubly robust estimators are a popular means of estimating causal effects. Such estimators combine an estimate of the conditional mean of the outcome given treatment and confounders (the so-called outcome regression) with an estimate of the conditional probability of treatment given confounders (the propensity score) to generate an estimate of the effect of interest. In addition to enjoying the double-robustness property, these estimators have additional benefits. First, flexible regression tools, such as those developed in the field of machine learning, can be utilized to estimate the relevant regressions, while the estimators of the treatment effects retain desirable statistical properties. Furthermore, these estimators are often statistically efficient, achieving the lower bound on the variance of regular, asymptotically linear estimators. However, in spite of their asymptotic optimality, in problems where causal estimands are weakly identifiable, these estimators may behave erratically. We propose new estimation techniques for use in these challenging settings. Our estimators build on two existing frameworks for efficient estimation: targeted minimum loss estimation and one-step estimation. However, rather than using an estimate of the propensity score in their construction, we instead opt for an alternative regression quantity when building our estimators: the conditional probability of treatment given the conditional mean outcome. We discuss the theoretical implications and demonstrate the estimators’ performance in simulated and real data.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic Bayesian networks have been well explored in the literature as discrete-time models; however, their continuous-time extensions have seen comparatively little attention. In this paper, we propose the first constraint-based algorithm for learning the structure of continuous-time Bayesian networks. We discuss the different statistical tests and the underlying hypotheses used by our proposal to establish conditional independence. Finally, we validate its performance using synthetic data, and discuss its strengths and limitations. We find that score-based is more accurate in learning networks with binary variables, while our constraint-based approach is more accurate with variables assuming more than two values. However, more experiments are needed for confirmation.",

    "abstract": "Given complex data collections, practitioners can perform non-parametric functional dependency discovery (FDD) to uncover relationships between variables that were previously unknown. However, known FDD methods are applicable to nominal data, and in practice non-nominal variables are discretized, e.g., in a pre-processing step. This is problematic because, as soon as a mix of discrete and continuous variables is involved, the interaction of discretization with the various dependency measures from the literature is poorly understood. In particular, it is unclear whether a given discretization method even leads to a consistent dependency estimate. In this paper, we analyze these fundamental questions and derive formal criteria as to when a discretization process applied to a mixed set of random variables leads to consistent estimates of mutual information. With these insights, we derive an estimator framework applicable to any task that involves estimating mutual information from multivariate and mixed-type data. Last, we extend with this framework a previously proposed FDD approach for reliable dependencies. Experimental evaluation shows that the derived reliable estimator is both computationally and statistically efficient, and leads to effective FDD algorithms for mixed-type data.",

    "abstract": "Identifying causal relationships and quantifying their strength from observational time series data are key problems in disciplines dealing with complex dynamical systems such as the Earth system or the human body. Data-driven causal inference in such systems is challenging since datasets are often high dimensional and nonlinear with limited sample sizes. Here, we introduce a novel method that flexibly combines linear or nonlinear conditional independence tests with a causal discovery algorithm to estimate causal networks from large-scale time series datasets. We validate the method on time series of well-understood physical mechanisms in the climate system and the human heart and using large-scale synthetic datasets mimicking the typical properties of real-world data. The experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in detection power, which opens up entirely new possibilities to discover and quantify causal networks from time series across a range of research fields.

Our solution accounts for linkage disequilibrium and diverse ancestries by combining conditional testing via knockoffs with hidden Markov models from state-of-the-art phasing methods. Furthermore, we account for familial relatedness by describing the joint distribution of haplotypes sharing long identical-by-descent segments with a generalized hidden Markov model. Extensive simulations affirm the validity of this method, while applications to UK Biobank phenotypes yield many more discoveries compared to BOLT-LMM, most of which are confirmed by the Japan Biobank and FinnGen data.\\</p\\>",

    "abstract": "Causal inference from observational data often assumes \"strong ignorability,\" that all confounders are observed. This assumption is standard yet untestable. However, many scientific studies involve multiple causes, different variables whose effects are simultaneously of interest. We propose the deconfounder, an algorithm that combines unsupervised machine learning and predictive model checking to perform causal inference in multiple-cause settings. The deconfounder infers a latent variable as a substitute for unobserved confounders and then uses that substitute to perform causal inference. We develop theory for when the deconfounder leads to unbiased causal estimates, and show that it requires weaker assumptions than classical causal inference. We analyze its performance in three types of studies: semi-simulated data around smoking and lung cancer, semi-simulated data around genomewide association studies, and a real dataset about actors and movie revenue. The deconfounder provides a checkable approach to estimating close-to-truth causal effects.",

    "abstract": "We address the problem of causal discovery from data, making use of the recently proposed causal modeling framework of modular structural causal models (mSCM) to handle cycles, latent confounders and non-linearities. We introduce {\\\\sigma}-connection graphs ({\\\\sigma}-CG), a new class of mixed graphs (containing undirected, bidirected and directed edges) with additional structure, and extend the concept of {\\\\sigma}-separation, the appropriate generalization of the well-known notion of d-separation in this setting, to apply to {\\\\sigma}-CGs. We prove the closedness of {\\\\sigma}-separation under marginalisation and conditioning and exploit this to implement a test of {\\\\sigma}-separation on a {\\\\sigma}-CG. This then leads us to the first causal discovery algorithm that can handle non-linear functional relations, latent confounders, cyclic causal relationships, and data from different (stochastic) perfect interventions. As a proof of concept, we show on synthetic data how well the algorithm recovers features of the causal graph of modular structural causal models.",

    "abstract": "The increasing availability of large healthcare databases is fueling an intense debate on whether real-world data should play a role in the assessment of the benefit–risk of medical treatments. In many observational studies, for example, statin users were found to have a substantially lower risk of cancer than in meta-analyses of randomized trials. Although such discrepancies are often attributed to a lack of randomization in the observational studies, they might be explained by flaws that can be avoided by explicitly emulating a target trial (the randomized trial that would answer the question of interest). Using the electronic health records of 733,804 UK adults, we emulated a target trial of statins and cancer and compared our estimates with those obtained using previously applied analytic approaches. Over the 10-yr follow-up, 28,408 individuals developed cancer. Under the target trial approach, estimated observational analogs of intention-to-treat and per-protocol 10-yr cancer-free survival differences were −0.5% (95% confidence interval (CI) −1.0%, 0.0%) and −0.3% (95% CI −1.5%, 0.5%), respectively. By contrast, previous analytic approaches yielded estimates that appeared to be strongly protective. Our findings highlight the importance of explicitly emulating a target trial to reduce bias in the effect estimates derived from observational analyses. Explicitly emulating a target trial using real-world data can avoid common biases in observational studies.",

    "abstract": "We introduce computational causal inference as an interdisciplinary field across causal inference, algorithms design and numerical computing. The field aims to develop software specializing in causal inference that can analyze massive datasets with a variety of causal effects, in a performant, general, and robust way. The focus on software improves research agility, and enables causal inference to be easily integrated into large engineering systems. In particular, we use computational causal inference to deepen the relationship between causal inference, online experimentation, and algorithmic decision making. This paper describes the new field, the demand, opportunities for scalability, open challenges, and begins the discussion for how the community can unite to solve challenges for scaling causal inference and decision making.",

    "abstract": "We study some of the most commonly used mutual information estimators, based on histograms of fixed or adaptive bin size, \\$k\\$-nearest neighbors and kernels, and focus on optimal selection of their free parameters. We examine the consistency of the estimators (convergence to a stable value with the increase of time series length) and the degree of deviation among the estimators. The optimization of parameters is assessed by quantifying the deviation of the estimated mutual information from its true or asymptotic value as a function of the free parameter. Moreover, some common-used criteria for parameter selection are evaluated for each estimator. The comparative study is based on Monte Carlo simulations on time series from several linear and nonlinear systems of different lengths and noise levels. The results show that the \\$k\\$-nearest neighbor is the most stable and less affected by the method-specific parameter. A data adaptive criterion for optimal binning is suggested for linear systems but it is found to be rather conservative for nonlinear systems. It turns out that the binning and kernel estimators give the least deviation in identifying the lag of the first minimum of mutual information from nonlinear systems, and are stable in the presence of noise.",

    "abstract": "We present a new method for linear and nonlinear, lagged and contemporaneous constraint-based causal discovery from observational time series in the presence of latent confounders. We show that existing causal discovery methods such as FCI and variants suffer from low recall in the autocorrelated time series case and identify low effect size of conditional independence tests as the main reason. Information-theoretical arguments show that effect size can often be increased if causal parents are included in the conditioning sets. To identify parents early on, we suggest an iterative procedure that utilizes novel orientation rules to determine ancestral relationships already during the edge removal phase. We prove that the method is order-independent, and sound and complete in the oracle case. Extensive simulation studies for different numbers of variables, time lags, sample sizes, and further cases demonstrate that our method indeed achieves much higher recall than existing methods while keeping false positives at the desired level. This performance gain grows with stronger autocorrelation. Our method also covers causal discovery for non-time series data as a special case. We provide Python code for all methods involved in the simulation studies.",

    "abstract": "The estimation of mutual information (MI) or conditional mutual information (CMI) from a set of samples is a long-standing problem. A recent line of work in this area has leveraged the approximation power of artificial neural networks and has shown improvements over conventional methods. One important challenge in this new approach is the need to obtain, given the original dataset, a different set where the samples are distributed according to a specific product density function. This is particularly challenging when estimating CMI. In this paper, we introduce a new technique, based on k nearest neighbors (k-NN), to perform the resampling and derive high-confidence concentration bounds for the sample average. Then the technique is employed to train a neural network classifier and the CMI is estimated accordingly. We propose three estimators using this technique and prove their consistency, make a comparison between them and similar approaches in the literature, and experimentally show improvements in estimating the CMI in terms of accuracy and variance of the estimators.",

Our approach, which we call MINT, is based on the estimation of mutual information, whose decomposition into joint and marginal entropies facilitates the use of recently-developed efficient entropy estimators derived from nearest neighbour distances. The proposed critical values, which may be obtained from simulation (in the case where one marginal is known) or resampling, guarantee that the test has nominal size, and we provide local power analyses, uniformly over classes of densities whose mutual information satisfies a lower bound. Our ideas may be extended to provide a new goodness-of-fit tests of normal linear models based on assessing the independence of our vector of covariates and an appropriately-defined notion of an error vector.

    "abstract": "Missing data are ubiquitous in many domains including healthcare. When these data entries are not missing completely at random, the (conditional) independence relations in the observed data may be different from those in the complete data generated by the underlying causal process. Consequently, simply applying existing causal discovery methods to the observed data may lead to wrong conclusions. In this paper, we aim at developing a causal discovery method to recover the underlying causal structure from observed data that follow different missingness mechanisms, including missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR), and missing not at random (MNAR). With missingness mechanisms represented by missingness graphs, we analyse conditions under which additional correction is needed to derive conditional independence/dependence relations in the complete data. Based on our analysis, we propose the Missing Value PC (MVPC) algorithm for both continuous and binary variables, which extends the PC algorithm to incorporate additional corrections. Our proposed MVPC is shown in theory to give asymptotically correct results even on data that are MAR or MNAR. Experimental results on synthetic data show that the proposed algorithm is able to find correct causal relations even in the general case of MNAR. Moreover, we create a neuropathic pain diagnostic simulator for evaluating causal discovery methods. Evaluated on such simulated neuropathic pain diagnosis records and the other two real world applications, MVPC outperforms the other benchmark methods.",

    "abstract": "In many data scientific problems, we are interested not only in modeling the behaviour of a system that is passively observed, but also in inferring how the system reacts to changes in the data generating mechanism. Given knowledge of the underlying causal structure, such behaviour can be estimated from purely observational data. To do so, one typically assumes that the causal structure of the data generating mechanism can be fully specified. Furthermore, many methods assume that data are generated as independent replications from that mechanism. Both of these assumptions are usually hard to justify in practice: datasets often have complex dependence structures, as is the case for spatio-temporal data, and the full causal structure between all involved variables is hardly known. Here, we present causal models that are adapted to the characteristics of spatio-temporal data, and which allow us to define and quantify causal effects despite incomplete causal background knowledge. We further introduce a simple approach for estimating causal effects, and a non-parametric hypothesis test for these effects being zero. The proposed methods do not rely on any distributional assumptions on the data, and allow for arbitrarily many latent confounders, given that these confounders do not vary across time (or, alternatively, they do not vary across space). Our theoretical findings are supported by simulations and code is available online. This work has been motivated by the following real-world question: how has the Colombian conflict influenced tropical forest loss? There is evidence for both enhancing and reducing impacts, but most literature analyzing this problem is not using formal causal methodology. When applying our method to data from 2000 to 2018, we find a reducing but insignificant causal effect of conflict on forest loss. Regionally, both enhancing and reducing effects can be identified.",

    "abstract": "There are numerous problems where one needs to quantify the dependence between two random variables and how this dependence changes by conditioning on a third random variable. Correlated random variables might become independent when we observe a third random variable or two independent random variables might become dependent after conditioning on the third one. Thanks to the wide potential application range e.g., bioinformatics, economics, psychology, etc, finding efficient measures of conditional dependence has been an active area of research in many subareas of statistics and machine learning. However, the literature on measures of conditional dependence is not so large, especially in the non-parametric setting. We introduce two novel measures of conditional dependence, and propose estimators based on i.i.d. samples. Using these statistics, we devise a new variable selection algorithm, called Feature Ordering by Conditional Independence (FOCI). FOCI is model-free with no tuning parameters and is provably consistent under sparsity assumptions. We provide a number of example application analyses to both synthetic and real datasets.",

Using microarray technology, it is possible to extract measurements of thousands of genes into a single analysis step having a picture of the cell gene expression. Several methods have been developed to infer gene networks from steady-state data, much less literature is produced about time-course data, so the development of algorithms to infer gene networks from time-series measurements is a current challenge into bioinformatics research area. In order to detect dependencies between genes at different time delays, we propose an approach to infer gene regulatory networks from time-series measurements starting from a well known algorithm based on information theory.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates relationships between white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology markers, and brain and hippocampal volume loss. Subjects included 198 controls, 345 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 154 AD subjects with serial volumetric 1.5-T MRI. CSF Aβ42 and total tau were measured (n = 353). Brain and hippocampal loss were quantified from serial MRI using the boundary shift integral (BSI). Multiple linear regression models assessed the relationships between WMHs and hippocampal and brain atrophy rates. Models were refitted adjusting for (a) concurrent brain/hippocampal atrophy rates and (b) CSF Aβ42 and tau in subjects with CSF data. WMH burden was positively associated with hippocampal atrophy rate in controls (P = 0.002) and MCI subjects (P = 0.03), and with brain atrophy rate in controls (P = 0.03). The associations with hippocampal atrophy rate remained following adjustment for concurrent brain atrophy rate in controls and MCIs, and for CSF biomarkers in controls (P = 0.007). These novel results suggest that vascular damage alongside AD pathology is associated with disproportionately greater hippocampal atrophy in nondemented older adults. © 2016 The Authors Hippocampus Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) in the brain are the consequence of cerebral small vessel disease, and can easily be detected on MRI. Over the past three decades, research has shown that the presence and extent of white matter hyperintense signals on MRI are important for clinical outcome, in terms of cognitive and functional impairment. Large, longitudinal population-based and hospital-based studies have confirmed a dose-dependent relationship between WMHs and clinical outcome, and have demonstrated a causal link between large confluent WMHs and dementia and disability. Adequate differential diagnostic assessment and management is of the utmost importance in any patient, but most notably those with incipient cognitive impairment. Novel imaging techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging might reveal subtle damage before it is visible on standard MRI. Even in Alzheimer disease, which is thought to be primarily caused by amyloid, vascular pathology, such as small vessel disease, may be of greater importance than amyloid itself in terms of influencing the disease course, especially in older individuals. Modification of risk factors for small vessel disease could be an important therapeutic goal, although evidence for effective interventions is still lacking. Here, we provide a timely Review on WMHs, including their relationship with cognitive decline and dementia.",

    "abstract": "Constraint-based causal discovery (CCD) algorithms require fast and accurate conditional independence (CI) testing. The Kernel Conditional Independence Test (KCIT) is currently one of the most popular CI tests in the non-parametric setting, but many investigators cannot use KCIT with large datasets because the test scales at least quadratically with sample size. We therefore devise two relaxations called the Randomized Conditional Independence Test (RCIT) and the Randomized conditional Correlation Test (RCoT) which both approximate KCIT by utilizing random Fourier features. In practice, both of the proposed tests scale linearly with sample size and return accurate p-values much faster than KCIT in the large sample size context. CCD algorithms run with RCIT or RCoT also return graphs at least as accurate as the same algorithms run with KCIT but with large reductions in run time.",

    "abstract": "Discovering causal relations is fundamental to reasoning and intelligence. In particular, observational causal discovery algorithms estimate the cause-effect relation between two random entities \\$X\\$ and \\$Y\\$, given \\$n\\$ samples from \\$P(X,Y)\\$. In this paper, we develop a framework to estimate the cause-effect relation between two static entities \\$x\\$ and \\$y\\$: for instance, an art masterpiece \\$x\\$ and its fraudulent copy \\$y\\$. To this end, we introduce the notion of proxy variables, which allow the construction of a pair of random entities \\$(A,B)\\$ from the pair of static entities \\$(x,y)\\$. Then, estimating the cause-effect relation between \\$A\\$ and \\$B\\$ using an observational causal discovery algorithm leads to an estimation of the cause-effect relation between \\$x\\$ and \\$y\\$. For example, our framework detects the causal relation between unprocessed photographs and their modifications, and orders in time a set of shuffled frames from a video. As our main case study, we introduce a human-elicited dataset of 10,000 pairs of casually-linked pairs of words from natural language. Our methods discover 75% of these causal relations. Finally, we discuss the role of proxy variables in machine learning, as a general tool to incorporate static knowledge into prediction tasks.",

There are accurate methods for estimating MI that avoid problems with “binning” when both data sets are discrete or when both data sets are continuous. We present an accurate, non-binning MI estimator for the case of one discrete data set and one continuous data set. This case applies when measuring, for example, the relationship between base sequence and gene expression level, or the effect of a cancer drug on patient survival time. We also show how our method can be adapted to calculate the Jensen–Shannon divergence of two or more data sets.",

    "abstract": "The recent paper Cand\\\\‘es et al. (2018) introduced model-X knockoffs, a method for variable selection that provably and non-asymptotically controls the false discovery rate with no restrictions or assumptions on the dimensionality of the data or the conditional distribution of the response given the covariates. The one requirement for the procedure is that the covariate samples are drawn independently and identically from a precisely-known (but arbitrary) distribution. The present paper shows that the exact same guarantees can be made without knowing the covariate distribution fully, but instead knowing it only up to a parametric model with as many as \\$\\\\Omega(n\\^{}p)\\$ parameters, where \\$p\\$ is the dimension and \\$n\\^{}\\$ is the number of covariate samples (which may exceed the usual sample size \\$n\\$ of labeled samples when unlabeled samples are also available). The key is to treat the covariates as if they are drawn conditionally on their observed value for a sufficient statistic of the model. Although this idea is simple, even in Gaussian models conditioning on a sufficient statistic leads to a distribution supported on a set of zero Lebesgue measure, requiring techniques from topological measure theory to establish valid algorithms. We demonstrate how to do this for three models of interest, with simulations showing the new approach remains powerful under the weaker assumptions.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a machine for sampling approximate model-X knockoffs for arbitrary and unspecified data distributions using deep generative models. The main idea is to iteratively refine a knockoff sampling mechanism until a criterion measuring the validity of the produced knockoffs is optimized; this criterion is inspired by the popular maximum mean discrepancy in machine learning and can be thought of as measuring the distance to pairwise exchangeability between original and knockoff features. By building upon the existing model-X framework, we thus obtain a flexible and model-free statistical tool to perform controlled variable selection. Extensive numerical experiments and quantitative tests confirm the generality, effectiveness, and power of our deep knockoff machines. Finally, we apply this new method to a real study of mutations linked to changes in drug resistance in the human immunodeficiency virus.",

    "abstract": "The increasing availability of data has generated unprecedented prospects for network analyses in many biological fields, such as neuroscience (e.g., brain networks), genomics (e.g., gene-gene interaction networks), and ecology (e.g., species interaction networks). A powerful statistical framework for estimating such networks is Gaussian graphical models, but standard estimators for the corresponding graphs are prone to large numbers of false discoveries. In this paper, we introduce a novel graph estimator based on knockoffs that imitate the partial correlation structures of unconnected nodes. We show that this new estimator guarantees accurate control of the false discovery rate in theory, simulations, and biological applications, and we provide easy-to-use R code.",

    "abstract": "Pruning is a well-established technique for removing unnecessary structure from neural networks after training to improve the performance of inference. Several recent results have explored the possibility of pruning at initialization time to provide similar benefits during training. In particular, the \"lottery ticket hypothesis\" conjectures that typical neural networks contain small subnetworks that can train to similar accuracy in a commensurate number of steps. The evidence for this claim is that a procedure based on iterative magnitude pruning (IMP) reliably finds such subnetworks retroactively on small vision tasks. However, IMP fails on deeper networks, and proposed methods to prune before training or train pruned networks encounter similar scaling limitations. In this paper, we argue that these efforts have struggled on deeper networks because they have focused on pruning precisely at initialization. We modify IMP to search for subnetworks that could have been obtained by pruning early in training (0.1% to 7% through) rather than at iteration 0. With this change, it finds small subnetworks of deeper networks (e.g., 80% sparsity on Resnet-50) that can complete the training process to match the accuracy of the original network on more challenging tasks (e.g., ImageNet). In situations where IMP fails at iteration 0, the accuracy benefits of delaying pruning accrue rapidly over the earliest iterations of training. To explain these behaviors, we study subnetwork \"stability,\" finding that - as accuracy improves in this fashion - IMP subnetworks train to parameters closer to those of the full network and do so with improved consistency in the face of gradient noise. These results offer new insights into the opportunity to prune large-scale networks early in training and the behaviors underlying the lottery ticket hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "The goal of feature selection is to identify important features that are relevant to explain an outcome variable. Most of the work in this domain has focused on identifying globally relevant features, which are features that are related to the outcome using evidence across the entire dataset. We study a more fine-grained statistical problem: conditional feature selection, where a feature may be relevant depending on the values of the other features. For example in genetic association studies, variant \\$A\\$ could be associated with the phenotype in the entire dataset, but conditioned on variant \\$B\\$ being present it might be independent of the phenotype. In this sense, variant \\$A\\$ is globally relevant, but conditioned on \\$B\\$ it is no longer locally relevant in that region of the feature space. We present a generalization of the knockoff procedure that performs conditional feature selection while controlling a generalization of the false discovery rate (FDR) to the conditional setting. By exploiting the feature/response model-free framework of the knockoffs, the quality of the statistical FDR guarantee is not degraded even when we perform conditional feature selections. We implement this method and present an algorithm that automatically partitions the feature space such that it enhances the differences between selected sets in different regions, and validate the statistical theoretical results with experiments.",

    "abstract": "The discovery of biomarkers that are informative for cancer risk assessment, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment predictions is crucial. Recent advances in high-throughput genomics make it plausible to select biomarkers from the vast number of human genes in an unbiased manner. Yet, control of false discoveries is challenging given the large number of genes versus the relatively small number of patients in a typical cancer study. To ensure that most of the discoveries are true, we employ a knockoff procedure to control false discoveries. Our method is general and flexible, accommodating arbitrary covariate distributions, linear and nonlinear associations, and survival models. In simulations, our method compares favorably to the alternatives; its utility of identifying important genes in real clinical applications is demonstrated by the identification of seven genes associated with Breslow thickness in skin cutaneous melanoma patients.",

    "abstract": "This paper advocates against permute-and-predict (PaP) methods for interpreting black box functions. Methods such as the variable importance measures proposed for random forests, partial dependence plots, and individual conditional expectation plots remain popular because of their ability to provide model-agnostic measures that depend only on the pre-trained model output. However, numerous studies have found that these tools can produce diagnostics that are highly misleading, particularly when there is strong dependence among features. Rather than simply add to this growing literature by further demonstrating such issues, here we seek to provide an explanation for the observed behavior. In particular, we argue that breaking dependencies between features in hold-out data places undue emphasis on sparse regions of the feature space by forcing the original model to extrapolate to regions where there is little to no data. We explore these effects through various settings where a ground-truth is understood and find support for previous claims in the literature that PaP metrics tend to over-emphasize correlated features both in variable importance and partial dependence plots, even though applying permutation methods to the ground-truth models do not. As an alternative, we recommend more direct approaches that have proven successful in other settings: explicitly removing features, conditional permutations, or model distillation methods.",

    "abstract": "An important problem in many domains is to predict how a system will respond to interventions. This task is inherently linked to estimating the system’s underlying causal structure. To this end, Invariant Causal Prediction (ICP) [1] has been proposed which learns a causal model exploiting the invariance of causal relations using data from different environments. When considering linear models, the implementation of ICP is relatively straightforward. However, the nonlinear case is more challenging due to the difficulty of performing nonparametric tests for conditional independence.",

    "abstract": "Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) is a linear representation learning method that seeks maximally correlated variables in multi-view data. Non-linear CCA extends this notion to a broader family of transformations, which are more powerful for many real-world applications. Given the joint probability, the Alternating Conditional Expectation (ACE) provides an optimal solution to the non-linear CCA problem. However, it suffers from limited performance and an increasing computational burden when only a finite number of observations is available. In this work we introduce an information-theoretic framework for the non-linear CCA problem (ITCCA), which extends the classical ACE approach. Our suggested framework seeks compressed representations of the data that allow a maximal level of correlation. This way we control the trade-off between the flexibility and the complexity of the representation. Our approach demonstrates favorable performance at a reduced computational burden, compared to non-linear alternatives, in a finite sample size regime. Further, ITCCA provides theoretical bounds and optimality conditions, as we establish fundamental connections to rate-distortion theory, the information bottleneck and remote source coding. In addition, it implies a \"soft\" dimensionality reduction, as the compression level is measured (and governed) by the mutual information between the original noisy data and the signals that we extract.",

    "abstract": "Pearson’s \\$\\\\rho\\$ is the most used measure of statistical dependence. It gives a complete characterization of dependence in the Gaussian case, and it also works well in some non-Gaussian situations. It is well known, however, that it has a number of shortcomings; in particular for heavy tailed distributions and in nonlinear situations, where it may produce misleading, and even disastrous results. In recent years a number of alternatives have been proposed. In this paper, we will survey these developments, especially results obtained in the last couple of decades. Among measures discussed are the copula, distribution-based measures, the distance covariance, the HSIC measure popular in machine learning, and finally the local Gaussian correlation, which is a local version of Pearson’s \\$\\\\rho\\$. Throughout we put the emphasis on conceptual developments and a comparison of these. We point out relevant references to technical details as well as comparative empirical and simulated experiments. There is a broad selection of references under each topic treated.",

    "abstract": "We present a thermodynamical approach to identify changes in macromolecular structure and dynamics in response to perturbations such as mutations or ligand binding, using an expansion of the Kullback-Leibler Divergence that connects local population shifts in torsion angles to changes in the free energy landscape of the protein. While the Kullback-Leibler Divergence is a known formula from information theory, the novelty and power of our implementation lies in its formal developments, connection to thermodynamics, statistical filtering, ease of visualization of results, and extendability by adding higher-order terms. We present a formal derivation of the Kullback-Leibler Divergence expansion and then apply our method at a first-order approximation to molecular dynamics simulations of four protein systems where ligand binding or pH titration is known to cause an effect at a distant site. Our results qualitatively agree with experimental measurements of local changes in structure or dynamics, such as NMR chemical shift perturbations and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry. The approach produces easy-to-analyze results with low background, and as such has the potential to become a routine analysis when molecular dynamics simulations in two or more conditions are available. Our method is implemented in the MutInf code package and is available on the SimTK website at https://simtk.org/home/mutinf.",

    "abstract": "Although anaesthesiologists strive to avoid hypoxaemia during surgery, reliably predicting future intraoperative hypoxaemia is not possible at present. Here, we report the development and testing of a machine-learning-based system that predicts the risk of hypoxaemia and provides explanations of the risk factors in real time during general anaesthesia. The system, which was trained on minute-by-minute data from the electronic medical records of over 50,000 surgeries, improved the performance of anaesthesiologists by providing interpretable hypoxaemia risks and contributing factors. The explanations for the predictions are broadly consistent with the literature and with prior knowledge from anaesthesiologists. Our results suggest that if anaesthesiologists currently anticipate 15% of hypoxaemia events, with the assistance of this system they could anticipate 30%, a large portion of which may benefit from early intervention because they are associated with modifiable factors. The system can help improve the clinical understanding of hypoxaemia risk during anaesthesia care by providing general insights into the exact changes in risk induced by certain characteristics of the patient or procedure.",

    "abstract": "Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction’s accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.",

    "abstract": "An important problem in machine learning and statistics is to identify features that causally affect the outcome. This is often impossible to do from purely observational data, and a natural relaxation is to identify features that are correlated with the outcome even conditioned on all other observed features. For example, we want to identify that smoking really is correlated with cancer conditioned on demographics. The knockoff procedure is a recent breakthrough in statistics that, in theory, can identify truly correlated features while guaranteeing that the false discovery is limited. The idea is to create synthetic data -knockoffs- that captures correlations amongst the features. However there are substantial computational and practical challenges to generating and using knockoffs. This paper makes several key advances that enable knockoff application to be more efficient and powerful. We develop an efficient algorithm to generate valid knockoffs from Bayesian Networks. Then we systematically evaluate knockoff test statistics and develop new statistics with improved power. The paper combines new mathematical guarantees with systematic experiments on real and synthetic data.",

    "abstract": "Model-X knockoffs is a wrapper that transforms essentially any feature importance measure into a variable selection algorithm, which discovers true effects while rigorously controlling the expected fraction of false positives. A frequently discussed challenge to apply this method is to construct knockoff variables, which are synthetic variables obeying a crucial exchangeability property with the explanatory variables under study. This paper introduces techniques for knockoff generation in great generality: we provide a sequential characterization of all possible knockoff distributions, which leads to a Metropolis-Hastingsformulation of an exact knockoff sampler. We further show how to use conditional independence structure to speed up computations. Combining these two threads, we introduce an explicit set of sequential algorithms and empirically demonstrate their effectiveness. Our theoretical analysis proves that our algorithms achieve near-optimal computational complexity in certain cases. The techniques we develop are sufficiently rich to enable knockoff sampling in challenging models including cases where the covariates are continuous and heavy-tailed, and follow a graphical model such as the Ising model.",

    "abstract": "Background The inference of complex networks from data is a challenging problem in biological sciences, as well as in a wide range of disciplines such as chemistry, technology, economics, or sociology. The quantity and quality of the data greatly affect the results. While many methodologies have been developed for this task, they seldom take into account issues such as missing data or outlier detection and correction, which need to be properly addressed before network inference.Results Here we present an approach to (i) handle missing data and (ii) detect and correct outliers based on multivariate projection to latent structures. The method, called trimmed scores regression (TSR), enables network inference methods to analyse incomplete datasets by imputing the missing values coherently with the latent data structure. Furthermore, it substitutes the faulty values in a dataset by proper estimations. We provide an implementation of this approach, and show how it can be integrated with any network inference method as a preliminary data curation step. This functionality is demonstrated with a state of the art network inference method based on mutual information distance and entropy reduction, MIDER.Conclusion The methodology presented here enables network inference methods to analyse a large number of incomplete and faulty datasets that could not be reliably analysed so far. Our comparative studies show the superiority of TSR over other missing data approaches used by practitioners. Furthermore, the method allows for outlier detection and correction.Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12859-015-0717-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",

    "abstract": "Distance correlation is a new class of multivariate dependence coefficients applicable to random vectors of arbitrary and not necessarily equal dimension. Distance covariance and distance correlation are analogous to product-moment covariance and correlation, but generalize and extend these classical bivariate measures of dependence. Distance correlation characterizes independence: it is zero if and only if the random vectors are independent. The notion of covariance with respect to a stochastic process is introduced, and it is shown that population distance covariance coincides with the covariance with respect to Brownian motion; thus, both can be called Brownian distance covariance. In the bivariate case, Brownian covariance is the natural extension of product-moment covariance, as we obtain Pearson product-moment covariance by replacing the Brownian motion in the definition with identity. The corresponding statistic has an elegantly simple computing formula. Advantages of applying Brownian covariance and correlation vs the classical Pearson covariance and correlation are discussed and illustrated.",

    "abstract": "Summary: The accurate reconstruction of gene regulatory networks from large scale molecular profile datasets represents one of the grand challenges of Systems Biology. The Algorithm for the Reconstruction of Accurate Cellular Networks (ARACNe) represents one of the most effective tools to accomplish this goal. However, the initial Fixed Bandwidth (FB) implementation is both inefficient and unable to deal with sample sets providing largely uneven coverage of the probability density space. Here, we present a completely new implementation of the algorithm, based on an Adaptive Partitioning strategy (AP) for estimating the Mutual Information. The new AP implementation (ARACNe-AP) achieves a dramatic improvement in computational performance (200× on average) over the previous methodology, while preserving the Mutual Information estimator and the Network inference accuracy of the original algorithm. Given that the previous version of ARACNe is extremely demanding, the new version of the algorithm will allow even researchers with modest computational resources to build complex regulatory networks from hundreds of gene expression profiles., Availability and Implementation: A JAVA cross-platform command line executable of ARACNe, together with all source code and a detailed usage guide are freely available on Sourceforge (http://sourceforge.net/projects/aracne-ap). JAVA version 8 or higher is required., Contact: califano\\@c2b2.columbia.edu, Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning is the mainstream technique for many machine learning tasks, including image recognition, machine translation, speech recognition, and so on. It has outperformed conventional methods in various fields and achieved great successes. Unfortunately, the understanding on how it works remains unclear. It has the central importance to lay down the theoretic foundation for deep learning. In this work, we give a geometric view to understand deep learning: we show that the fundamental principle attributing to the success is the manifold structure in data, namely natural high dimensional data concentrates close to a low-dimensional manifold, deep learning learns the manifold and the probability distribution on it. We further introduce the concepts of rectified linear complexity for deep neural network measuring its learning capability, rectified linear complexity of an embedding manifold describing the difficulty to be learned. Then we show for any deep neural network with fixed architecture, there exists a manifold that cannot be learned by the network. Finally, we propose to apply optimal mass transportation theory to control the probability distribution in the latent space.",

Since the advent of high-throughput measurement technologies in biology in the late 90s, reconstructing the structure of such networks has been a central computational problem in systems biology. While the problem is certainly not solved in its entirety, considerable progress has been made in the last two decades, with mature tools now available. This chapter aims to provide an introduction to the basic concepts underpinning network inference tools, attempting a categorisation which highlights commonalities and relative strengths. While the chapter is meant to be self-contained, the material presented should provide a useful background to the later, more specialised chapters of this book.",

We present a new pairwise model for graphical models with both continuous and discrete variables that is amenable to structure learning. In previous work, authors have considered structure learning of Gaussian graphical models and structure learning of discrete models. Our approach is a natural generalization of these two lines of work to the mixed case. The penalization scheme involves a novel symmetric use of the group-lasso norm and follows naturally from a particular parameterization of the model.

    "abstract": "Understanding gene regulatory networks is critical to understanding cellular differentiation and response to external stimuli. Methods for global network inference have been developed and applied to a variety of species. Most approaches consider the problem of network inference independently in each species, despite evidence that gene regulation can be conserved even in distantly related species. Further, network inference is often confined to single data-types (single platforms) and single cell types. We introduce a method for multi-source network inference that allows simultaneous estimation of gene regulatory networks in multiple species or biological processes through the introduction of priors based on known gene relationships such as orthology incorporated using fused regression. This approach improves network inference performance even when orthology mapping and conservation are incomplete. We refine this method by presenting an algorithm that extracts the true conserved subnetwork from a larger set of potentially conserved interactions and demonstrate the utility of our method in cross species network inference. Last, we demonstrate our method’s utility in learning from data collected on different experimental platforms.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen an emergence of network modeling applied to moods, attitudes, and problems in the realm of psychology. In this framework, psychological variables are understood to directly affect each other rather than being caused by an unobserved latent entity. In this tutorial, we introduce the reader to estimating the most popular network model for psychological data: the partial correlation network. We describe how regularization techniques can be used to efficiently estimate a parsimonious and interpretable network structure in psychological data. We show how to perform these analyses in R and demonstrate the method in an empirical example on post-traumatic stress disorder data. In addition, we discuss the effect of the hyperparameter that needs to be manually set by the researcher, how to handle non-normal data, how to determine the required sample size for a network analysis, and provide a checklist with potential solutions for problems that can arise when estimating regularized partial correlation networks.",

    "abstract": "Network analysis is entering fields where network structures are unknown, such as psychology and the educational sciences. A crucial step in the application of network models lies in the assessment of network structure. Current methods either have serious drawbacks or are only suitable for Gaussian data. In the present paper, we present a method for assessing network structures from binary data. Although models for binary data are infamous for their computational intractability, we present a computationally efficient model for estimating network structures. The approach, which is based on Ising models as used in physics, combines logistic regression with model selection based on a Goodness-of-Fit measure to identify relevant relationships between variables that define connections in a network. A validation study shows that this method succeeds in revealing the most relevant features of a network for realistic sample sizes. We apply our proposed method to estimate the network of depression and anxiety symptoms from symptom scores of 1108 subjects. Possible extensions of the model are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Genomics has revolutionized biology, enabling the interrogation of whole transcriptomes, genome-wide binding sites for proteins, and many other molecular processes. However, individual genomic assays measure elements that interact in vivo as components of larger molecular machines. Understanding how these high-order interactions drive gene expression presents a substantial statistical challenge. Building on random forests (RFs) and random intersection trees (RITs) and through extensive, biologically inspired simulations, we developed the iterative random forest algorithm (iRF). iRF trains a feature-weighted ensemble of decision trees to detect stable, high-order interactions with the same order of computational cost as the RF. We demonstrate the utility of iRF for high-order interaction discovery in two prediction problems: enhancer activity in the early Drosophila embryo and alternative splicing of primary transcripts in human-derived cell lines. In Drosophila, among the 20 pairwise transcription factor interactions iRF identifies as stable (returned in more than half of bootstrap replicates), 80% have been previously reported as physical interactions. Moreover, third-order interactions, e.g., between Zelda (Zld), Giant (Gt), and Twist (Twi), suggest high-order relationships that are candidates for follow-up experiments. In human-derived cells, iRF rediscovered a central role of H3K36me3 in chromatin-mediated splicing regulation and identified interesting fifth- and sixth-order interactions, indicative of multivalent nucleosomes with specific roles in splicing regulation. By decoupling the order of interactions from the computational cost of identification, iRF opens additional avenues of inquiry into the molecular mechanisms underlying genome biology.",

    "abstract": "The practice of epidemiology requires asking causal questions. Formal frameworks for causal inference developed over the past decades have the potential to improve the rigor of this process. However, the appropriate role for formal causal thinking in applied epidemiology remains a matter of debate. We argue that a formal causal framework can help in designing a statistical analysis that comes as close as possible to answering the motivating causal question, while making clear what assumptions are required to endow the resulting estimates with a causal interpretation. A systematic approach for the integration of causal modeling with statistical estimation is presented. We highlight some common points of confusion that occur when causal modeling techniques are applied in practice and provide a broad overview on the types of questions that a causal framework can help to address. Our aims are to argue for the utility of formal causal thinking, to clarify what causal models can and cannot do, and to provide an accessible introduction to the flexible and powerful tools provided by causal models.",

    "abstract": "Quantification and identification of cellular phenotypes from high content microscopy images have proven to be very useful for understanding biological activity in response to different drug treatments. The traditional approach has been to use classical image analysis to quantify changes in cell morphology, which requires several non-trivial and independent analysis steps. Recently convolutional neural networks have emerged as a compelling alternative, offering good predictive performance and the possibility to replace traditional workflows with a single network architecture. In this study we applied the pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks ResNet50, InceptionV3 and InceptionResnetV2 to predict cell mechanisms of action in response to chemical perturbations for two cell profiling datasets from the Broad Bioimage Benchmark Collection. These networks were pre-trained on ImageNet enabling much quicker model training. We obtain higher predictive accuracy than previously reported, between 95 and 97% based on ’leave-one-compound-out’ cross-validation. The ability to quickly and accurately distinguish between different cell morphologies from a scarce amount of labelled data illustrates the combined benefit of transfer learning and deep convolutional neural networks for interrogating cell-based images.",

    "abstract": "The broad abundance of time series data, which is in sharp contrast to limited knowledge of the underlying network dynamic processes that produce such observations, calls for a rigorous and efficient method of causal network inference. Here we develop mathematical theory of causation entropy, an information-theoretic statistic designed for model-free causality inference. For stationary Markov processes, we prove that for a given node in the network, its causal parents form the minimal set of nodes that maximizes causation entropy, a result we refer to as the optimal causation entropy principle. Furthermore, this principle guides us in developing computational and data efficient algorithms for causal network inference based on a two-step discovery and removal algorithm for time series data for a network-coupled dynamical system. Validation in terms of analytical and numerical results for Gaussian processes on large random networks highlights that inference by our algorithm outperforms previous leading methods, including conditional Granger causality and transfer entropy. Interestingly, our numerical results suggest that the number of samples required for accurate inference depends strongly on network characteristics such as the density of links and information diffusion rate and not necessarily on the number of nodes.",

    "abstract": "In this theory paper, we investigate training deep neural networks (DNNs) for classification via minimizing the information bottleneck (IB) functional. We show that, even if the joint distribution between continuous feature variables and the discrete class variable is known, the resulting optimization problem suffers from two severe issues: First, for deterministic DNNs, the IB functional is infinite for almost all weight matrices, making the optimization problem ill-posed. Second, the invariance of the IB functional under bijections prevents it from capturing desirable properties for classification, such as robustness, architectural simplicity, and simplicity of the learned representation. We argue that these issues are partly resolved for stochastic DNNs, DNNs that include a (hard or soft) decision rule, or by replacing the IB functional with related, but more well-behaved cost functions. We conclude that recent successes reported about training DNNs using the IB framework must be attributed to such solutions. As a side effect, our results imply limitations of the IB framework for the analysis of DNNs.",

    "abstract": "Graphical causal models are an important tool for knowledge discovery because they can represent both the causal relations between variables and the multivariate probability distributions over the data. Once learned, causal graphs can be used for classification, feature selection and hypothesis generation, while revealing the underlying causal network structure and thus allowing for arbitrary likelihood queries over the data. However, current algorithms for learning sparse directed graphs are generally designed to handle only one type of data (continuous-only or discrete-only), which limits their applicability to a large class of multi-modal biological datasets that include mixed type variables. To address this issue, we developed new methods that modify and combine existing methods for finding undirected graphs with methods for finding directed graphs. These hybrid methods are not only faster, but also perform better than the directed graph estimation methods alone for a variety of parameter settings and data set sizes. Here, we describe a new conditional independence test for learning directed graphs over mixed data types and we compare performances of different graph learning strategies on synthetic data.",

    "abstract": "Mutual information-based network inference algorithms are an important tool in the reverse-engineering of transcriptional regulatory networks, but all rely on estimates of the mutual information between the expression of pairs of genes. Various methods exist to compute estimates of the mutual information, but none have been firmly established as optimal for network inference. The performance of 9 mutual information estimation methods are compared using three popular network inference algorithms: CLR, MRNET and ARACNE. The performance of the estimators is compared on one synthetic and two real datasets. For estimators that discretise data, the effect of discretisation parameters are also studied in detail. Implementations of 5 estimators are provided in parallelised C++ with an R interface. These are faster than alternative implementations, with reductions in computation time up to a factor of 3,500. The B-spline estimator consistently performs well on real and synthetic datasets. CLR was found to be the best performing inference algorithm, corroborating previous results indicating that it is the state of the art mutual inference algorithm. It is also found to be robust to the mutual information estimation method and their parameters. Furthermore, when using an estimator that discretises expression data, using N 1/3 bins for N samples gives the most accurate inferred network. This contradicts previous findings that suggested using N 1/2 bins.",

    "abstract": "We propose the ‘Copula PC’ algorithm for causal discovery from a combination of continuous and discrete data, assumed to be drawn from a Gaussian copula model. It is based on a two-step approach. The first step applies Gibbs sampling on rank-based data to obtain samples of correlation matrices. These are then translated into an average correlation matrix and an effective number of data points, which in the second step are input to the standard PC algorithm for causal discovery. A stable version naturally arises when rerunning the PC algorithm on different Gibbs samples. Our ‘Copula PC’ algorithm extends the ‘Rank PC’ algorithm, which has been designed for Gaussian copula models for purely continuous data. In simulations, ‘Copula PC’ indeed outperforms ‘Rank PC’ in cases with mixed variables, in particular for larger numbers of data points, at the expense of a slight increase in computation time.",

    "abstract": "The evidence that most adult-onset common diseases have a polygenic genetic architecture fully consistent with robust biological systems supported by multiple back-up mechanisms is now overwhelming. In this context, we consider the recent “omnigenic” or “core genes” model. A key assumption of the model is that there is a relatively small number of core genes relevant to any disease. While intuitively appealing, this model may underestimate the biological complexity of common disease, and therefore, the goal to discover core genes should not guide experimental design. We consider other implications of polygenicity, concluding that a focus on patient stratification is needed to achieve the goals of precision medicine.",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of causal structure learning from data with missing values, assumed to be drawn from a Gaussian copula model. First, we extend the ‘Rank PC’ algorithm, designed for Gaussian copula models with purely continuous data (so-called nonparanormal models), to incomplete data by applying rank correlation to pairwise complete observations and replacing the sample size with an effective sample size in the conditional independence tests to account for the information loss from missing values. When the data are missing completely at random (MCAR), we provide an error bound on the accuracy of ‘Rank PC’ and show its high-dimensional consistency. However, when the data are missing at random (MAR), ‘Rank PC’ fails dramatically. Therefore, we propose a Gibbs sampling procedure to draw correlation matrix samples from mixed data that still works correctly under MAR. These samples are translated into an average correlation matrix and an effective sample size, resulting in the ‘Copula PC’ algorithm for incomplete data. Simulation study shows that: (1) ‘Copula PC’ estimates a more accurate correlation matrix and causal structure than ‘Rank PC’ under MCAR and, even more so, under MAR and (2) the usage of the effective sample size significantly improves the performance of ‘Rank PC’ and ‘Copula PC.’ We illustrate our methods on two real-world datasets: riboflavin production data and chronic fatigue syndrome data.",

    "abstract": "The Correlation Power Analysis (CPA) is probably the most used side-channel attack because it seems to fit the power model of most standard CMOS devices and is very efficiently computed. However, the Pearson correlation coefficient used in the CPA measures only linear statistical dependences where the Mutual Information (MI) takes into account both linear and nonlinear dependences. Even if there can be simultaneously large correlation coefficients quantified by the correlation coefficient and weak dependences quantified by the MI, we can expect to get a more profound understanding about interactions from an MI Analysis (MIA). We study methods that improve the non-parametric Probability Density Functions (PDF) in the estimation of the entropies and, in particular, the use of B-spline basis functions as pdf estimators. Our results indicate an improvement of two fold in the number of required samples compared to a classic MI estimation. The B-spline smoothing technique can also be applied to the rencently introduced Cramér-von-Mises test.",

    "abstract": "Given two time series X and Y, their mutual information, I(X,Y)=I(Y,X), is the average number of bits of X that can be predicted by measuring Y and vice versa. In the analysis of observational data, calculation of mutual information occurs in three contexts: identification of nonlinear correlation, determination of an optimal sampling interval, particularly when embedding data, and in the investigation of causal relationships with directed mutual information. In this contribution a minimum description length argument is used to determine the optimal number of elements to use when characterizing the distributions of X and Y. However, even when using partitions of the X and Y axis indicated by minimum description length, mutual information calculations performed with a uniform partition of the XY plane can give misleading results. This motivated the construction of an algorithm for calculating mutual information that uses an adaptive partition. This algorithm also incorporates an explicit test of the statistical independence of X and Y in a calculation that returns an assessment of the corresponding null hypothesis. The previously published Fraser-Swinney algorithm for calculating mutual information includes a sophisticated procedure for local adaptive control of the partitioning process. When the Fraser and Swinney algorithm and the algorithm constructed here are compared, they give very similar numerical results (less than 4% difference in a typical application). Detailed comparisons are possible when X and Y are correlated jointly Gaussian distributed because an analytic expression for I(X,Y) can be derived for that case. Based on these tests, three conclusions can be drawn. First, the algorithm constructed here has an advantage over the Fraser-Swinney algorithm in providing an explicit calculation of the probability of the null hypothesis that X and Y are independent. Second, the Fraser-Swinney algorithm is marginally the more accurate of the two algorithms when large data sets are used. With smaller data sets, however, the Fraser-Swinney algorithm reports structures that disappear when more data are available. Third, the algorithm constructed here requires about 0.5% of the computation time required by the Fraser-Swinney algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Characterising programs of gene regulation by studying individual protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions would require a large volume of high-resolution proteomics data, and such data are not yet available. Instead, many gene regulatory network (GRN) techniques have been developed, which leverage the wealth of transcriptomic data generated by recent consortia to study indirect, gene-level relationships between transcriptional regulators. Despite the popularity of such methods, previous methods of GRN inference exhibit limitations that we highlight and address through the lens of information theory.",

    "abstract": "Deep CNNs are known to exhibit the following peculiarity: on the one hand they generalize extremely well to a test set, while on the other hand they are extremely sensitive to so-called adversarial perturbations. The extreme sensitivity of high performance CNNs to adversarial examples casts serious doubt that these networks are learning high level abstractions in the dataset. We are concerned with the following question: How can a deep CNN that does not learn any high level semantics of the dataset manage to generalize so well? The goal of this article is to measure the tendency of CNNs to learn surface statistical regularities of the dataset. To this end, we use Fourier filtering to construct datasets which share the exact same high level abstractions but exhibit qualitatively different surface statistical regularities. For the SVHN and CIFAR-10 datasets, we present two Fourier filtered variants: a low frequency variant and a randomly filtered variant. Each of the Fourier filtering schemes is tuned to preserve the recognizability of the objects. Our main finding is that CNNs exhibit a tendency to latch onto the Fourier image statistics of the training dataset, sometimes exhibiting up to a 28% generalization gap across the various test sets. Moreover, we observe that significantly increasing the depth of a network has a very marginal impact on closing the aforementioned generalization gap. Thus we provide quantitative evidence supporting the hypothesis that deep CNNs tend to learn surface statistical regularities in the dataset rather than higher-level abstract concepts.",

    "abstract": "The inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from expression data can mine the direct regulations among genes and gain deep insights into biological processes at a network level. During past decades, numerous computational approaches have been introduced for inferring the GRNs. However, many of them still suffer from various problems, e.g., Bayesian network (BN) methods cannot handle large-scale networks due to their high computational complexity, while information theory-based methods cannot identify the directions of regulatory interactions and also suffer from false positive/negative problems. To overcome the limitations, in this work we present a novel algorithm, namely local Bayesian network (LBN), to infer GRNs from gene expression data by using the network decomposition strategy and false-positive edge elimination scheme. Specifically, LBN algorithm first uses conditional mutual information (CMI) to construct an initial network or GRN, which is decomposed into a number of local networks or GRNs. Then, BN method is employed to generate a series of local BNs by selecting the k-nearest neighbors of each gene as its candidate regulatory genes, which significantly reduces the exponential search space from all possible GRN structures. Integrating these local BNs forms a tentative network or GRN by performing CMI, which reduces redundant regulations in the GRN and thus alleviates the false positive problem. The final network or GRN can be obtained by iteratively performing CMI and local BN on the tentative network. In the iterative process, the false or redundant regulations are gradually removed. When tested on the benchmark GRN datasets from DREAM challenge as well as the SOS DNA repair network in E.coli, our results suggest that LBN outperforms other state-of-the-art methods (ARACNE, GENIE3 and NARROMI) significantly, with more accurate and robust performance. In particular, the decomposition strategy with local Bayesian networks not only effectively reduce the computational cost of BN due to much smaller sizes of local GRNs, but also identify the directions of the regulations.",

    "abstract": "Robustness of deep learning models is a property that has recently gained increasing attention. We formally define a notion of robustness for generative adversarial models, and show that, perhaps surprisingly, the GAN in its original form is not robust. Indeed, the discriminator in GANs may be viewed as merely offering \"teaching feedback\". Our notion of robustness relies on a dishonest discriminator, or noisy, adversarial interference with its feedback. We explore, theoretically and empirically, the effect of model and training properties on this robustness. In particular, we show theoretical conditions for robustness that are supported by empirical evidence. We also test the effect of regularization. Our results suggest variations of GANs that are indeed more robust to noisy attacks, and have overall more stable training behavior.",

    "abstract": "The question of continuous-versus-discrete information representation in the brain is a fundamental yet unresolved physiological question. Historically, most analyses assume a continuous representation without considering the alternative possibility of a discrete representation. Our work explores the plausibility of both representations, and answers the question from a communications engineering perspective. Drawing on the well-established Shannon’s communications theory, we posit that information in the brain is represented in a discrete form. Using a computer simulation, we show that information cannot be communicated reliably between neurons using a continuous representation, due to the presence of noise; neural information has to be in a discrete form. In addition, we designed 3 (human) behavioral experiments on probability estimation and analyzed the data using a novel discrete (quantized) model of probability. Under a discrete model of probability, two distinct probabilities (say, 0.57 and 0.58) are treated indifferently. We found that data from all participants were better fit to discrete models than continuous ones. Furthermore, we re-analyzed the data from a published (human) behavioral study on intertemporal choice using a novel discrete (quantized) model of intertemporal choice. Under such a model, two distinct time delays (say, 16 days and 17 days) are treated indifferently. We found corroborating results, showing that data from all participants were better fit to discrete models than continuous ones. In summary, all results reported here support our discrete hypothesis of information representation in the brain, which signifies a major demarcation from the current understanding of the brain’s physiology.",

    "abstract": "Important information on the structure of complex systems can be obtained by measuring to what extent the individual components exchange information among each other. The linear Granger approach, to detect cause-effect relationships between time series, has emerged in recent years as a leading statistical technique to accomplish this task. Here we generalize Granger causality to the nonlinear case using the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Our method performs linear Granger causality in the feature space of suitable kernel functions, assuming arbitrary degree of nonlinearity. We develop a new strategy to cope with the problem of overfitting, based on the geometry of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Applications to coupled chaotic maps and physiological data sets are presented.",

We explore the applicability of t-SNE to human genetic data and make these observations: (i) similar to previously used dimension reduction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA), t-SNE is able to separate samples from different continents; (ii) unlike PCA, t-SNE is more robust with respect to the presence of outliers; (iii) t-SNE is able to display both continental and sub-continental patterns in a single plot. We conclude that the ability for t-SNE to reveal population stratification at different scales could be useful for human genetic association studies.\\</p\\>",

    "abstract": "\\<p\\>Late-onset Alzheimers disease (LOAD, onset age &gt; 60 years) is the most prevalent dementia in the elderly, and risk is partially driven by genetics. Many of the loci responsible for this genetic risk were identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). To identify additional LOAD risk loci, we performed the largest GWAS to date (89,769 individuals), analyzing both common and rare variants. We confirm 20 previous LOAD risk loci and identify four new genome-wide loci (<i>IQCK</i>, <i>ACE</i>, <i>ADAM10</i>, and <i>ADAMTS1</i>). Pathway analysis of these data implicates the immune system and lipid metabolism, and for the first time tau binding proteins and APP metabolism. These findings show that genetic variants affecting APP and Abeta processing are not only associated with early-onset autosomal dominant AD but also with LOAD. Analysis of AD risk genes and pathways show enrichment for rare variants (P = 1.32 x 10$^{\\textrm{-7}}$) indicating that additional rare variants remain to be identified.\\</p\\>",

As GWAS increase in size, so does the computational complexity of such evaluations; standard practice repeatedly simulates and analyses genotype data for all individuals in an example study. We have developed a novel method based on an alternative approach, directly simulating GWAS summary data, without individual data as an intermediate step. We mathematically derive the expected statistics for any set of causal variants and their effect sizes, conditional upon control haplotype frequencies (available from public reference datasets). Simulation of GWAS summary output can be conducted independently of sample size by simulating random variates about these expected values. Across a range of scenarios, our method, available as an open source R package, produces very similar output to that from simulating individual genotypes with a substantial gain in speed even for modest sample sizes. Fast simulation of GWAS summary statistics will enable more complete and rapid evaluation of summary statistic methods as well as opening new potential avenues of research in fine mapping and gene set enrichment analysis.\\</p\\>",

    "abstract": "\\<p\\>In our recent publication, we examined the two heritability models most widely used when estimating SNP heritability: the GCTA Model, which is used by the software GCTA and upon which LD Score regression (LDSC) is based, and the LDAK Model, which is used by our software LDAK. First we demonstrated the importance of choosing an appropriate heritability model, by showing that estimates of SNP heritability can be highly sensitive to which model is assumed. Then we empirically tested the GCTA and LDAK Models on GWAS data for a wide variety of complex traits. We found that the LDAK Model fits real data both significantly and substantially better than the GCTA Model, indicating that LDAK estimates more accurately describe the genetic architecture of complex traits than those from GCTA or LDSC. Some of our most striking results were our revised estimates of functional enrichments (the heritability enrichments of SNP categories defined by functional annotations). In general, estimates from LDAK were substantially more modest than previous estimates based on the GCTA Model. For example, we estimated that DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHS) were 1.4-fold (SD 0.1) enriched, whereas a study using GCTA had found they were 5.1-fold (SD 0.5) enriched, and we estimated that conserved SNPs were 1.3-fold (SD 0.3) enriched, whereas a study using S-LDSC (stratified LDSC) had found they were 13.3-fold (SD 1.5) enriched. In their correspondence, Gazal et al. dispute our findings. They assert that the heritability model assumed by LDSC is more realistic than the LDAK Model, and that estimates of enrichment from S-LDSC are more accurate than those from LDAK. Here, we explain why their justification for preferring the model used by LDSC is incorrect, and provide a simple demonstration that S-LDSC produces unreliable estimates of enrichment.\\</p\\>",

    "abstract": "Somatic cells acquire mutations throughout the course of an individual’s life. Mutations occurring early in embryogenesis are often present in a substantial proportion of, but not all, cells in postnatal humans and thus have particular characteristics and effects1. Depending on their location in the genome and the proportion of cells they are present in, these mosaic mutations can cause a wide range of genetic disease syndromes2 and predispose carriers to cancer3,4. They have a high chance of being transmitted to offspring as de novo germline mutations and, in principle, can provide insights into early human embryonic cell lineages and their contributions to adult tissues5. Although it is known that gross chromosomal abnormalities are remarkably common in early human embryos6, our understanding of early embryonic somatic mutations is very limited. Here we use whole-genome sequences of normal blood from 241 adults to identify 163 early embryonic mutations. We estimate that approximately three base substitution mutations occur per cell per cell-doubling event in early human embryogenesis and these are mainly attributable to two known mutational signatures7. We used the mutations to reconstruct developmental lineages of adult cells and demonstrate that the two daughter cells of many early embryonic cell-doubling events contribute asymmetrically to adult blood at an approximately 2:1 ratio. This study therefore provides insights into the mutation rates, mutational processes and developmental outcomes of cell dynamics that operate during early human embryogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Summary: Cell differentiation processes are achieved through a continuum of hierarchical intermediate cell states that might be captured by single-cell RNA seq. Existing computational approaches for the assessment of cell-state hierarchies from single-cell data can be formalized under a general framework composed of (i) a metric to assess cell-to-cell similarities (with or without a dimensionality reduction step) and (ii) a graph-building algorithm (optionally making use of a cell clustering step). The Sincell R package implements a methodological toolbox allowing flexible workflows under such a framework. Furthermore, Sincell contributes new algorithms to provide cell-state hierarchies with statistical support while accounting for stochastic factors in single-cell RNA seq. Graphical representations and functional association tests are provided to interpret hierarchies. The functionalities of Sincell are illustrated in a real case study, which demonstrates its ability to discriminate noisy from stable cell-state hierarchies., Availability and implementation: Sincell is an open-source R/Bioconductor package available at http://bioconductor.org/packages/sincell. A detailed manual and a vignette are provided with the package., Contact: antonio.rausell\\@isb-sib.ch, Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the training and performance of generative adversarial networks using the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) as critic, termed MMD GANs. As our main theoretical contribution, we clarify the situation with bias in GAN loss functions raised by recent work: we show that gradient estimators used in the optimization process for both MMD GANs and Wasserstein GANs are unbiased, but learning a discriminator based on samples leads to biased gradients for the generator parameters. We also discuss the issue of kernel choice for the MMD critic, and characterize the kernel corresponding to the energy distance used for the Cramer GAN critic. Being an integral probability metric, the MMD benefits from training strategies recently developed for Wasserstein GANs. In experiments, the MMD GAN is able to employ a smaller critic network than the Wasserstein GAN, resulting in a simpler and faster-training algorithm with matching performance. We also propose an improved measure of GAN convergence, the Kernel Inception Distance, and show how to use it to dynamically adapt learning rates during GAN training.",

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are analyzed via the theoretical framework of the information bottleneck (IB) principle. We first show that any DNN can be quantified by the mutual information between the layers and the input and output variables. Using this representation we can calculate the optimal information theoretic limits of the DNN and obtain finite sample generalization bounds. The advantage of getting closer to the theoretical limit is quantifiable both by the generalization bound and by the network’s simplicity. We argue that both the optimal architecture, number of layers and features/connections at each layer, are related to the bifurcation points of the information bottleneck tradeoff, namely, relevant compression of the input layer with respect to the output layer. The hierarchical representations at the layered network naturally correspond to the structural phase transitions along the information curve. We believe that this new insight can lead to new optimality bounds and deep learning algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Despite their great success, there is still no comprehensive theoretical understanding of learning with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) or their inner organization. Previous work proposed to analyze DNNs in the \\\\textit{Information Plane}; i.e., the plane of the Mutual Information values that each layer preserves on the input and output variables. They suggested that the goal of the network is to optimize the Information Bottleneck (IB) tradeoff between compression and prediction, successively, for each layer. In this work we follow up on this idea and demonstrate the effectiveness of the Information-Plane visualization of DNNs. Our main results are: (i) most of the training epochs in standard DL are spent on {\\\\emph compression} of the input to efficient representation and not on fitting the training labels. (ii) The representation compression phase begins when the training errors becomes small and the Stochastic Gradient Decent (SGD) epochs change from a fast drift to smaller training error into a stochastic relaxation, or random diffusion, constrained by the training error value. (iii) The converged layers lie on or very close to the Information Bottleneck (IB) theoretical bound, and the maps from the input to any hidden layer and from this hidden layer to the output satisfy the IB self-consistent equations. This generalization through noise mechanism is unique to Deep Neural Networks and absent in one layer networks. (iv) The training time is dramatically reduced when adding more hidden layers. Thus the main advantage of the hidden layers is computational. This can be explained by the reduced relaxation time, as this it scales super-linearly (exponentially for simple diffusion) with the information compression from the previous layer.",

    "abstract": "Information bottleneck [IB] is a technique for extracting information in some ‘input’ random variable that is relevant for predicting some different ’output’ random variable. IB works by encoding the input in a compressed ’bottleneck variable’ from which the output can then be accurately decoded. IB can be difficult to compute in practice, and has been mainly developed for two limited cases: (1) discrete random variables with small state spaces, and (2) continuous random variables that are jointly Gaussian distributed (in which case the encoding and decoding maps are linear). We propose a method to perform IB in more general domains. Our approach can be applied to discrete or continuous inputs and outputs, and allows for nonlinear encoding and decoding maps. The method uses a novel upper bound on the IB objective, derived using a non-parametric estimator of mutual information and a variational approximation. We show how to implement the method using neural networks and gradient-based optimization, and demonstrate its performance on the MNIST dataset.",

    "abstract": "Generative adversarial networks (GAN) have been effective for learning generative models for real-world data. However, existing GANs (GAN and its variants) tend to suffer from training problems such as instability and mode collapse. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN framework called evolutionary generative adversarial networks (E-GAN) for stable GAN training and improved generative performance. Unlike existing GANs, which employ a pre-defined adversarial objective function alternately training a generator and a discriminator, we utilize different adversarial training objectives as mutation operations and evolve a population of generators to adapt to the environment (i.e., the discriminator). We also utilize an evaluation mechanism to measure the quality and diversity of generated samples, such that only well-performing generator(s) are preserved and used for further training. In this way, E-GAN overcomes the limitations of an individual adversarial training objective and always preserves the best offspring, contributing to progress in and the success of GANs. Experiments on several datasets demonstrate that E-GAN achieves convincing generative performance and reduces the training problems inherent in existing GANs.",

    "abstract": "Do GANS (Generative Adversarial Nets) actually learn the target distribution? The foundational paper of (Goodfellow et al 2014) suggested they do, if they were given sufficiently large deep nets, sample size, and computation time. A recent theoretical analysis in Arora et al (to appear at ICML 2017) raised doubts whether the same holds when discriminator has finite size. It showed that the training objective can approach its optimum value even if the generated distribution has very low support —in other words, the training objective is unable to prevent mode collapse. The current note reports experiments suggesting that such problems are not merely theoretical. It presents empirical evidence that well-known GANs approaches do learn distributions of fairly low support, and thus presumably are not learning the target distribution. The main technical contribution is a new proposed test, based upon the famous birthday paradox, for estimating the support size of the generated distribution.",

Using unbiased single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of \\~2400 cells, we identified six human DCs and four monocyte subtypes in human blood. Our study reveals: a new DC subset that shares properties with plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) but potently activates T cells, thus redefining pDCs; a new subdivision within the CD1C+ subset of DCs; the relationship between blastic plasmacytoid DC neoplasia cells and healthy DCs; and circulating progenitor of conventional DCs (cDCs).

    "abstract": "Dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes play a central role in pathogen sensing, phagocytosis and antigen presentation and consist of multiple specialized subtypes. However, their identities and interrelationships are not fully understood. Using unbiased single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of \\~2400 cells, we identified six human DCs and four monocyte subtypes in human blood. Our study reveals: a new DC subset that shares properties with plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) but potently activates T cells, thus redefining pDCs; a new subdivision within the CD1C+ subset of DCs; the relationship between blastic plasmacytoid DC neoplasia cells and healthy DCs; and circulating progenitor of conventional DCs (cDCs). Our revised taxonomy will enable more accurate functional and developmental analyses as well as immune monitoring in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Data preprocessing is a major and essential stage whose main goal is to obtain final data sets that can be considered correct and useful for further data mining algorithms. This paper summarizes the most influential data preprocessing algorithms according to their usage, popularity and extensions proposed in the specialized literature. For each algorithm, we provide a description, a discussion on its impact, and a review of current and further research on it. These most influential algorithms cover missing values imputation, noise filtering, dimensionality reduction (including feature selection and space transformations), instance reduction (including selection and generation), discretization and treatment of data for imbalanced preprocessing. They constitute all among the most important topics in data preprocessing research and development. This paper emphasizes on the most well-known preprocessing methods and their practical study, selected after a recent, generic book on data preprocessing that does not deepen on them. This manuscript also presents an illustrative study in two sections with different data sets that provide useful tips for the use of preprocessing algorithms. In the first place, we graphically present the effects on two benchmark data sets for the preprocessing methods. The reader may find useful insights on the different characteristics and outcomes generated by them. Secondly, we use a real world problem presented in the ECDBL’2014 Big Data competition to provide a thorough analysis on the application of some preprocessing techniques, their combination and their performance. As a result, five different cases are analyzed, providing tips that may be useful for readers.",

    "abstract": "Identifying interesting relationships between pairs of variables in large datasets is increasingly important. Here, we present a measure of dependence for two-variable relationships: the maximal information coefficient (MIC). MIC captures a wide range of associations both functional and not, and for functional relationships provides a score that roughly equals the coefficient of determination (R2) of the data relative to the regression function. MIC belongs to a larger class of maximal information-based nonparametric exploration (MINE) statistics for identifying and classifying relationships. We apply MIC and MINE to datasets in global health, gene expression, major-league baseball, and the human gut microbiota, and identify known and novel relationships.",

    "abstract": "How should one quantify the strength of association between two random variables without bias for relationships of a specific form? Despite its conceptual simplicity, this notion of statistical “equitability” has yet to receive a definitive mathematical formalization. Here we argue that equitability is properly formalized by a self-consistency condition closely related to Data Processing Inequality. Mutual information, a fundamental quantity in information theory, is shown to satisfy this equitability criterion. These findings are at odds with the recent work of Reshef et al. [Reshef DN, et al. (2011) Science 334(6062):1518–1524], which proposed an alternative definition of equitability and introduced a new statistic, the “maximal information coefficient” (MIC), said to satisfy equitability in contradistinction to mutual information. These conclusions, however, were supported only with limited simulation evidence, not with mathematical arguments. Upon revisiting these claims, we prove that the mathematical definition of equitability proposed by Reshef et al. cannot be satisfied by any (nontrivial) dependence measure. We also identify artifacts in the reported simulation evidence. When these artifacts are removed, estimates of mutual information are found to be more equitable than estimates of MIC. Mutual information is also observed to have consistently higher statistical power than MIC. We conclude that estimating mutual information provides a natural (and often practical) way to equitably quantify statistical associations in large datasets.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing is becoming effective and accessible as emerging technologies push its scale to millions of cells and beyond. Visualizing the landscape of single cell expression has been a fundamental tool in single cell analysis. However, standard methods for visualization, such as t-stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), not only lack scalability to data sets with millions of cells, but also are unable to generalize to new cells, an important ability for transferring knowledge across fast-accumulating data sets. We introduce net-SNE, which trains a neural network to learn a high quality visualization of single cells that newly generalizes to unseen data. While matching the visualization quality of t-SNE on 14 benchmark data sets of varying sizes, from hundreds to 1.3 million cells, net-SNE also effectively positions previously unseen cells, even when an entire subtype is missing from the initial data set or when the new cells are from a different sequencing experiment. Furthermore, given a \"reference\" visualization, net-SNE can vastly reduce the computational burden of visualizing millions of single cells from multiple days to just a few minutes of runtime. Our work provides a general framework for newly bootstrapping single cell analysis from existing data sets.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) provides a comprehensive measurement of stochasticity in transcription, but the limitations of the technology have prevented its application to dissect variability in RNA processing events such as splicing. Here, we present BRIE (Bayesian regression for isoform estimation), a Bayesian hierarchical model that resolves these problems by learning an informative prior distribution from sequence features. We show that BRIE yields reproducible estimates of exon inclusion ratios in single cells and provides an effective tool for differential isoform quantification between scRNA-seq data sets. BRIE, therefore, expands the scope of scRNA-seq experiments to probe the stochasticity of RNA processing.",

    "abstract": "Network modeling has proven to be a fundamental tool in analyzing the inner workings of a cell. It has revolutionized our understanding of biological processes and made significant contributions to the discovery of disease biomarkers. Much effort has been devoted to reconstruct various types of biochemical networks using functional genomic datasets generated by high-throughput technologies. This paper discusses statistical methods used to reconstruct gene regulatory networks using gene expression data. In particular, we highlight progress made and challenges yet to be met in the problems involved in estimating gene interactions, inferring causality and modeling temporal changes of regulation behaviors. As rapid advances in technologies have made available diverse, large-scale genomic data, we also survey methods of incorporating all these additional data to achieve better, more accurate inference of gene networks.",

    "abstract": "Network modeling has proven to be a fundamental tool in analyzing the inner workings of a cell. It has revolutionized our understanding of biological processes and made significant contributions to the discovery of disease biomarkers. Much effort has been devoted to reconstruct various types of biochemical networks using functional genomic datasets generated by high-throughput technologies. This paper discusses statistical methods used to reconstruct gene regulatory networks using gene expression data. In particular, we highlight progress made and challenges yet to be met in the problems involved in estimating gene interactions, inferring causality and modeling temporal changes of regulation behaviors. As rapid advances in technologies have made available diverse, large-scale genomic data, we also survey methods of incorporating all these additional data to achieve better, more accurate inference of gene networks.",

    "abstract": "One important problem in genome science is to determine sets of co-regulated genes based on measurements of gene expression levels across samples, where the quantification of expression levels includes substantial technical and biological noise. To address this problem, we developed a Bayesian sparse latent factor model that uses a three parameter beta prior to flexibly model shrinkage in the loading matrix. By applying three layers of shrinkage to the loading matrix (global, factor-specific, and element-wise), this model has non-parametric properties in that it estimates the appropriate number of factors from the data. We added a two-component mixture to model each factor loading as being generated from either a sparse or a dense mixture component; this allows dense factors that capture confounding noise, and sparse factors that capture local gene interactions. We developed two statistics to quantify the stability of the recovered matrices for both sparse and dense matrices. We tested our model on simulated data and found that we successfully recovered the true latent structure as compared to related models. We applied our model to a large gene expression study and found that we recovered known covariates and small groups of co-regulated genes. We validated these gene subsets by testing for associations between genotype data and these latent factors, and we found a substantial number of biologically important genetic regulators for the recovered gene subsets.",

There are accurate methods for estimating MI that avoid problems with “binning” when both data sets are discrete or when both data sets are continuous. We present an accurate, non-binning MI estimator for the case of one discrete data set and one continuous data set. This case applies when measuring, for example, the relationship between base sequence and gene expression level, or the effect of a cancer drug on patient survival time. We also show how our method can be adapted to calculate the Jensen–Shannon divergence of two or more data sets.",

    "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been shown to be able to sample impressively realistic images. GAN training consists of a saddle point optimization problem that can be thought of as an adversarial game between a generator which produces the images, and a discriminator, which judges if the images are real. Both the generator and the discriminator are commonly parametrized as deep convolutional neural networks. The goal of this paper is to disentangle the contribution of the optimization procedure and the network parametrization to the success of GANs. To this end we introduce and study Generative Latent Optimization (GLO), a framework to train a generator without the need to learn a discriminator, thus avoiding challenging adversarial optimization problems. We show experimentally that GLO enjoys many of the desirable properties of GANs: learning from large data, synthesizing visually-appealing samples, interpolating meaningfully between samples, and performing linear arithmetic with noise vectors.",

    "abstract": "Estimating mutual information from observed samples is a basic primitive, useful in several machine learning tasks including correlation mining, information bottleneck clustering, learning a Chow-Liu tree, and conditional independence testing in (causal) graphical models. While mutual information is a well-defined quantity in general probability spaces, existing estimators can only handle two special cases of purely discrete or purely continuous pairs of random variables. The main challenge is that these methods first estimate the (differential) entropies of X, Y and the pair (X;Y) and add them up with appropriate signs to get an estimate of the mutual information. These 3H-estimators cannot be applied in general mixture spaces, where entropy is not well-defined. In this paper, we design a novel estimator for mutual information of discrete-continuous mixtures. We prove that the proposed estimator is consistent. We provide numerical experiments suggesting superiority of the proposed estimator compared to other heuristics of adding small continuous noise to all the samples and applying standard estimators tailored for purely continuous variables, and quantizing the samples and applying standard estimators tailored for purely discrete variables. This significantly widens the applicability of mutual information estimation in real-world applications, where some variables are discrete, some continuous, and others are a mixture between continuous and discrete components.",

We introduce a class of CNNs called deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANs), that have certain architectural constraints, and demonstrate that they are a strong candidate for unsupervised learning. Training on various image datasets, we show convincing evidence that our deep convolutional adversarial pair learns a hierarchy of representations from object parts to scenes in both the generator and discriminator. Additionally, we use the learned features for novel tasks - demonstrating their applicability as general image representations.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances have enabled gene expression profiling of single cells at lower cost. As more data is produced there is an increasing need to integrate diverse datasets and better analyse underutilised data to gain biological insights. However, analysis of single cell RNA-seq data is challenging due to biological and technical noise which not only varies between laboratories but also between batches. Here for the first time, we apply a new generative deep learning approach called Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to biological data. We show that it is possible to integrate diverse skin (epidermal) datasets and in doing so, our generative model is able to simulate realistic scRNA-seq data that covers the full diversity of cell types. In contrast to many machine-learning approaches, we are able to interpret internal parameters in a biologically meaningful manner. These include using internal GAN learned features for improved dimensionality reduction. Using our generative model we are able to obtain a universal representation of epidermal differentiation and use this to predict the effect of cell state perturbations on gene expression at high time-resolution. We show that our trained neural networks identify biological state-determining genes and through analysis of these networks we can obtain inferred gene regulatory relationships. In combination these attributes provide a powerful framework to progress the analysis of scRNA-seq data beyond exploratory analysis of cell clusters and towards integration of multiple datasets regardless of origin.",

    "abstract": "Estimating mutual information (MI) from samples is a fundamental problem in statistics, machine learning, and data analysis. Recently it was shown that a popular class of non-parametric MI estimators perform very poorly for strongly dependent variables and have sample complexity that scales exponentially with the true MI. This undesired behavior was attributed to the reliance of those estimators on local uniformity of the underlying (and unknown) probability density function. Here we present a novel semi-parametric estimator of mutual information, where at each sample point, densities are {\\\\em locally} approximated by a Gaussians distribution. We demonstrate that the estimator is asymptotically unbiased. We also show that the proposed estimator has a superior performance compared to several baselines, and is able to accurately measure relationship strengths over many orders of magnitude.",

    "abstract": "For analysis of a high-dimensional dataset, a common approach is to test a null hypothesis of statistical independence on all variable pairs using a non-parametric measure of dependence. However, because this approach attempts to identify any non-trivial relationship no matter how weak, it often identifies too many relationships to be useful. What is needed is a way of identifying a smaller set of relationships that merit detailed further analysis. Here we formally present and characterize equitability, a property of measures of dependence that aims to overcome this challenge. Notionally, an equitable statistic is a statistic that, given some measure of noise, assigns similar scores to equally noisy relationships of different types [Reshef et al. 2011]. We begin by formalizing this idea via a new object called the interpretable interval, which functions as an interval estimate of the amount of noise in a relationship of unknown type. We define an equitable statistic as one with small interpretable intervals. We then draw on the equivalence of interval estimation and hypothesis testing to show that under moderate assumptions an equitable statistic is one that yields well powered tests for distinguishing not only between trivial and non-trivial relationships of all kinds but also between non-trivial relationships of different strengths. This means that equitability allows us to specify a threshold relationship strength \\$x\\_0\\$ and to search for relationships of all kinds with strength greater than \\$x\\_0\\$. Thus, equitability can be thought of as a strengthening of power against independence that enables fruitful analysis of data sets with a small number of strong, interesting relationships and a large number of weaker ones. We conclude with a demonstration of how our two equivalent characterizations of equitability can be used to evaluate the equitability of a statistic in practice.",

    "abstract": "Quantitatively identifying direct dependencies between variables is an important task in data analysis, in particular for reconstructing various types of networks and causal relations in science and engineering. One of the most widely used criteria is partial correlation, but it can only measure linearly direct association and miss nonlinear associations. However, based on conditional independence, conditional mutual information (CMI) is able to quantify nonlinearly direct relationships among variables from the observed data, superior to linear measures, but suffers from a serious problem of underestimation, in particular for those variables with tight associations in a network, which severely limits its applications. In this work, we propose a new concept, “partial independence,” with a new measure, “part mutual information” (PMI), which not only can overcome the problem of CMI but also retains the quantification properties of both mutual information (MI) and CMI. Specifically, we first defined PMI to measure nonlinearly direct dependencies between variables and then derived its relations with MI and CMI. Finally, we used a number of simulated data as benchmark examples to numerically demonstrate PMI features and further real gene expression data from Escherichia coli and yeast to reconstruct gene regulatory networks, which all validated the advantages of PMI for accurately quantifying nonlinearly direct associations in networks.",

    "abstract": "Observational analyses for causal inference often rely on real world data collected for purposes other than research. A frequent goal of these observational analyses is to use the data to emulate a hypothetical randomized experiment, i.e., the target trial, that mimics the design features of a true experiment, including a clear definition of time zero with synchronization of treatment assignment and determination of eligibility. We review a recent observational analysis that explicitly emulated a target trial of screening colonoscopy using insurance claims from U.S. Medicare. We then compare this explicit emulation with alternative, simpler observational analyses that do not synchronize treatment assignment and eligibility determination at time zero and/or do not allow for repeated eligibility. This empirical comparison suggests that lack of an explicit emulation of the target trial leads to biased estimates, and shows that allowing for repeated eligibility increases the statistical efficiency of the estimates.",

    "abstract": "We develop estimation for potentially high-dimensional additive structural equation models. A key component of our approach is to decouple order search among the variables from feature or edge selection in a directed acyclic graph encoding the causal structure. We show that the former can be done with nonregularized (restricted) maximum likelihood estimation while the latter can be efficiently addressed using sparse regression techniques. Thus, we substantially simplify the problem of structure search and estimation for an important class of causal models. We establish consistency of the (restricted) maximum likelihood estimator for low- and high-dimensional scenarios, and we also allow for misspecification of the error distribution. Furthermore, we develop an efficient computational algorithm which can deal with many variables, and the new method’s accuracy and performance is illustrated on simulated and real data.",

    "abstract": "What is the difference between a prediction that is made with a causal model and that with a non-causal model? Suppose that we intervene on the predictor variables or change the whole environment. The predictions from a causal model will in general work as well under interventions as for observational data. In contrast, predictions from a non-causal model can potentially be very wrong if we actively intervene on variables. Here, we propose to exploit this invariance of a prediction under a causal model for causal inference: given different experimental settings (e.g. various interventions) we collect all models that do show invariance in their predictive accuracy across settings and interventions. The causal model will be a member of this set of models with high probability. This approach yields valid confidence intervals for the causal relationships in quite general scenarios. We examine the example of structural equation models in more detail and provide sufficient assumptions under which the set of causal predictors becomes identifiable. We further investigate robustness properties of our approach under model misspecification and discuss possible extensions. The empirical properties are studied for various data sets, including large-scale gene perturbation experiments.",

    "abstract": "Motivation: Large-scale gene expression profiling generates data sets that are rich in observed features but poor in numbers of observations. The analysis of such data sets is a challenge that has been object of vigorous research. The algorithms in use for this purpose have been poorly documented and rarely compared objectively, posing a problem of uncertainty about the outcomes of the analyses. One way to objectively test such analysis algorithms is to apply them on computational gene network models for which the mechanisms are completely know.Results: We present a system that generates random artificial gene networks according to well-defined topological and kinetic properties. These are used to run in silico experiments simulating real laboratory microarray experiments. Noise with controlled properties is added to the simulation results several times emulating measurement replicates, before expression ratios are calculated.Availability: The data sets and kinetic models described here are available from http://www.vbi.vt.edu/\\~mendes/AGN/as biochemical dynamic models in SBML and Gepasi formats.Contact: mendes\\@vt.edu\\*To whom correspondence should be addressed.",

    "abstract": "Background Frustrated with the onslaught of articles reporting fascination with results that appear paradoxical but are merely due to selection bias, we studied the apparent effect of obesity on diabetes risk in youth who had a test for diabetes. We hypothesised that obese subjects would have lower rates of diabetes than non-obese subjects due to selection bias, and consequently, obesity would appear to lower the risk of diabetes. Methods Retrospective cohort study of children (4–9 years), pre-teens (10–12 years) and teenagers (13–19 years). Participation was restricted to those who had a test of haemoglobin A1C along with measured height and weight. Body mass index percentile via the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention age and sex standards was calculated and categorised. The main outcome was A1C%, subsequently categorised at the level for diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (≥6.5%). Results The sample consisted of 134 (2%) underweight, 1718 (30%) healthy weight, 660 (12%) overweight and 3190 (56%) obese individuals. 16% (n=936) had an A1C≥6.5%. Overall, healthy weight children had 8.2 times the risk of A1C≥6.5% (95% CI 5.3 to 12.7) compared with those in the obese category. The relative risk was 13 in pre-teens (95% CI 8.5 to 20.0) and 3.9 in teenagers (95% CI 3.3 to 4.7). Conclusions Healthy weight was associated with a 4–13 times higher relative risk of diabetes mellitus compared with being obese. While apparently shocking, the study’s fatal flaw (selection bias) explains the ‘paradoxical’ finding. Ignoring selection bias can delay advances in medical science.",

    "abstract": "Consider the following three important problems in statistical inference, namely, constructing confidence intervals for (1) the error of a high-dimensional (\\$p\\>n\\$) regression estimator, (2) the linear regression noise level, and (3) the genetic signal-to-noise ratio of a continuous-valued trait (related to the heritability). All three problems turn out to be closely related to the little-studied problem of performing inference on the \\$\\\\ell\\_2\\$-norm of the signal in high-dimensional linear regression. We derive a novel procedure for this, which is asymptotically correct when the covariates are multivariate Gaussian and produces valid confidence intervals in finite samples as well. The procedure, called EigenPrism, is computationally fast and makes no assumptions on coefficient sparsity or knowledge of the noise level. We investigate the width of the EigenPrism confidence intervals, including a comparison with a Bayesian setting in which our interval is just 5% wider than the Bayes credible interval. We are then able to unify the three aforementioned problems by showing that the EigenPrism procedure with only minor modifications is able to make important contributions to all three. We also investigate the robustness of coverage and find that the method applies in practice and in finite samples much more widely than just the case of multivariate Gaussian covariates. Finally, we apply EigenPrism to a genetic dataset to estimate the genetic signal-to-noise ratio for a number of continuous phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "In the causal adjustment setting, variable selection techniques based on one of either the outcome or treatment allocation model can result in the omission of confounders, which leads to bias, or the inclusion of spurious variables, which leads to variance inflation, in the propensity score. We propose a variable selection method based on a penalized objective function which considers the outcome and treatment assignment models simultaneously. The proposed method facilitates confounder selection in high-dimensional settings. We show that under regularity conditions our method attains the oracle property. The selected variables are used to form a doubly robust regression estimator of the treatment effect. We show that under some conditions our method attains the oracle property. Simulation results are presented and economic growth data are analyzed. Specifically, we study the effect of life expectancy as a measure of population health on the average growth rate of gross domestic product per capita.",

    "abstract": "Summary The three-dimensional configuration of DNA is integral to all nuclear processes in eukaryotes, yet our knowledge of the chromosome architecture is still limited. Genome-wide chromosome conformation capture studies have uncovered features of chromatin organization in cultured cells, but genome architecture in human tissues has yet to be explored. Here, we report the most comprehensive survey to date of chromatin organization in human tissues. Through integrative analysis of chromatin contact maps in 21 primary human tissues and cell types, we find topologically associating domains highly conserved in different tissues. We also discover genomic regions that exhibit unusually high levels of local chromatin interactions. These frequently interacting regions (FIREs) are enriched for super-enhancers and are near tissue-specifically expressed genes. They display strong tissue-specificity in local chromatin interactions. Additionally, FIRE formation is partially dependent on CTCF and the Cohesin complex. We further show that FIREs can help annotate the function of non-coding sequence variants.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression profiling of in vitro drug perturbations is useful for many biomedical discovery applications including drug repurposing and elucidation of drug mechanisms. However, limited data availability across cell types has hindered our capacity to leverage or explore the cell-specificity of these perturbations. While recent efforts have generated a large number of drug perturbation profiles across a variety of human cell types, many gaps remain in this combinatorial drug-cell space. Hence, we asked whether it is possible to fill these gaps by predicting cell-specific drug perturbation profiles using available expression data from related conditions–i.e. from other drugs and cell types. We developed a computational framework that first arranges existing profiles into a three-dimensional array (or tensor) indexed by drugs, genes, and cell types, and then uses either local (nearest-neighbors) or global (tensor completion) information to predict unmeasured profiles. We evaluate prediction accuracy using a variety of metrics, and find that the two methods have complementary performance, each superior in different regions in the drug-cell space. Predictions achieve correlations of 0.68 with true values, and maintain accurate differentially expressed genes (AUC 0.81). Finally, we demonstrate that the predicted profiles add value for making downstream associations with drug targets and therapeutic classes.",

Perturbations under study include drugs, genetic perturbations, tissue micro-environments, antibodies, and disease-causing mutations. Responses to perturbations are measured by transcript profiling, mass spectrometry, cell imaging, and biochemical methods, among other assays.

    "abstract": "We previously piloted the concept of a Connectivity Map (CMap), whereby genes, drugs, and disease states are connected by virtue of common gene-expression signatures. Here, we report more than a 1,000-fold scale-up of the CMap as part of the NIH LINCS Consortium, made possible by a new, low-cost, high-throughput reduced representation expression profiling method that we term L1000. We show that L1000 is highly reproducible, comparable to RNA sequencing, and suitable for computational inference of the expression levels of 81% of non-measured transcripts. We further show that the expanded CMap can be used to discover mechanism of action of small molecules, functionally annotate genetic variants of disease genes, and inform clinical trials. The 1.3 million L1000 profiles described here, as well as tools for their analysis, are available at https://clue.io.",

    "abstract": "Summary The three-dimensional configuration of DNA is integral to all nuclear processes in eukaryotes, yet our knowledge of the chromosome architecture is still limited. Genome-wide chromosome conformation capture studies have uncovered features of chromatin organization in cultured cells, but genome architecture in human tissues has yet to be explored. Here, we report the most comprehensive survey to date of chromatin organization in human tissues. Through integrative analysis of chromatin contact maps in 21 primary human tissues and cell types, we find topologically associating domains highly conserved in different tissues. We also discover genomic regions that exhibit unusually high levels of local chromatin interactions. These frequently interacting regions (FIREs) are enriched for super-enhancers and are near tissue-specifically expressed genes. They display strong tissue-specificity in local chromatin interactions. Additionally, FIRE formation is partially dependent on CTCF and the Cohesin complex. We further show that FIREs can help annotate the function of non-coding sequence variants.",

The associated problems of parameter estimation (model calibration) and optimal experimental design are particularly challenging.

However, there is a lack of suitable benchmark problems which allow a fair and systematic evaluation and comparison of these contributions.",

The package allows various options for delay parameters and can easily included in reactions for promoter delay, RNA delay and Protein delay. A user can tune these parameters to model various types of reactions within a cell. As examples, we present two network models to generate expression profiles. We also demonstrated the inference of networks and the evaluation of association measure of edge and non-edge components from the generated expression profiles.",

    "abstract": "Network models are widely used to describe complex signaling systems. Cellular wiring varies in different cellular contexts and numerous inference techniques have been developed to infer the structure of a network from experimental data of the network’s behavior. To objectively identify which inference strategy is best suited to a specific network, a gold standard network and dataset are required. However, suitable datasets for benchmarking are difficult to find. Numerous tools exist that can simulate data for transcriptional networks, but these are of limited use for the study of signaling networks. Here, we describe SiGNet (Signal Generator for Networks): a Cytoscape app that simulates experimental data for a signaling network of known structure. SiGNet has been developed and tested against published experimental data, incorporating information on network architecture, and the directionality and strength of interactions to create biological data in silico. SiGNet is the first tool to simulate biological signaling data, enabling an accurate and systematic assessment of inference strategies. SiGNet can also be used to produce preliminary models of key biological pathways following perturbation.",

    "abstract": "There is intense interest in applying machine learning to problems of causal inference in fields such as healthcare, economics and education. In particular, individual-level causal inference has important applications such as precision medicine. We give a new theoretical analysis and family of algorithms for predicting individual treatment effect (ITE) from observational data, under the assumption known as strong ignorability. The algorithms learn a \"balanced\" representation such that the induced treated and control distributions look similar. We give a novel, simple and intuitive generalization-error bound showing that the expected ITE estimation error of a representation is bounded by a sum of the standard generalization-error of that representation and the distance between the treated and control distributions induced by the representation. We use Integral Probability Metrics to measure distances between distributions, deriving explicit bounds for the Wasserstein and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) distances. Experiments on real and simulated data show the new algorithms match or outperform the state-of-the-art.",

    "abstract": "We consider structural equation models in which variables can be written as a function of their parents and noise terms, which are assumed to be jointly independent. Corresponding to each structural equation model, there is a directed acyclic graph describing the relationships between the variables. In Gaussian structural equation models with linear functions, the graph can be identified from the joint distribution only up to Markov equivalence classes, assuming faithfulness. In this work, we prove full identifiability if all noise variables have the same variances: the directed acyclic graph can be recovered from the joint Gaussian distribution. Our result has direct implications for causal inference: if the data follow a Gaussian structural equation model with equal error variances and assuming that all variables are observed, the causal structure can be inferred from observational data only. We propose a statistical method and an algorithm that exploit our theoretical findings.",

    "abstract": "Due to the presence of systematic measurement biases, data normalization is an essential preprocessing step in the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. While a variety of normalization procedures are available for bulk RNA-seq, their suitability with respect to single-cell data is still largely unexplored. Furthermore, there may be multiple, competing considerations behind the assessment of normalization performance, some of them study-specific. The choice of normalization method can have a large impact on the results of downstream analyses (e.g., clustering, inference of cell lineages, differential expression analysis), and thus it is critically important to assess the performance of competing methods in order to select a suitable procedure for the study at hand. We have developed scone - a framework that implements a wide range of normalization procedures in the context of scRNA-seq, and enables the assessment of their performance based on a comprehensive set of data-driven performance metrics. The accompanying open-source Bioconductor R software package scone (available at https://bioconductor.org/packages/scone) also provides numerical and graphical summaries of expression measures, data quality assessment, and data-adaptive gene and sample filtering criteria. We demonstrate the effectiveness of scone on a selection of scRNA-seq datasets across a variety of protocols, ranging from plate- to droplet-based methods. We show that scone is able to correctly rank normalization methods according to their performance in a given dataset and that selecting the best performing normalization leads to higher agreement with independent validation data than lowly-ranked methods.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we propose methods for estimating heterogeneity in causal effects in experimental and observational studies and for conducting hypothesis tests about the magnitude of differences in treatment effects across subsets of the population. We provide a data-driven approach to partition the data into subpopulations that differ in the magnitude of their treatment effects. The approach enables the construction of valid confidence intervals for treatment effects, even with many covariates relative to the sample size, and without “sparsity” assumptions. We propose an “honest” approach to estimation, whereby one sample is used to construct the partition and another to estimate treatment effects for each subpopulation. Our approach builds on regression tree methods, modified to optimize for goodness of fit in treatment effects and to account for honest estimation. Our model selection criterion anticipates that bias will be eliminated by honest estimation and also accounts for the effect of making additional splits on the variance of treatment effect estimates within each subpopulation. We address the challenge that the “ground truth” for a causal effect is not observed for any individual unit, so that standard approaches to cross-validation must be modified. Through a simulation study, we show that for our preferred method honest estimation results in nominal coverage for 90% confidence intervals, whereas coverage ranges between 74% and 84% for nonhonest approaches. Honest estimation requires estimating the model with a smaller sample size; the cost in terms of mean squared error of treatment effects for our preferred method ranges between 7–22%.",

    "abstract": "Many scientific and engineering challenges – ranging from personalized medicine to customized marketing recommendations – require an understanding of treatment effect heterogeneity. In this paper, we develop a non-parametric causal forest for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects that extends Breiman’s widely used random forest algorithm. In the potential outcomes framework with unconfoundedness, we show that causal forests are pointwise consistent for the true treatment effect, and have an asymptotically Gaussian and centered sampling distribution. We also discuss a practical method for constructing asymptotic confidence intervals for the true treatment effect that are centered at the causal forest estimates. Our theoretical results rely on a generic Gaussian theory for a large family of random forest algorithms. To our knowledge, this is the first set of results that allows any type of random forest, including classification and regression forests, to be used for provably valid statistical inference. In experiments, we find causal forests to be substantially more powerful than classical methods based on nearest-neighbor matching, especially in the presence of irrelevant covariates.",

    "abstract": "Demand for clinical decision support systems in medicine and self-diagnostic symptom checkers has substantially increased in recent years. Existing platforms rely on knowledge bases manually compiled through a labor-intensive process or automatically derived using simple pairwise statistics. This study explored an automated process to learn high quality knowledge bases linking diseases and symptoms directly from electronic medical records. Medical concepts were extracted from 273,174 de-identified patient records and maximum likelihood estimation of three probabilistic models was used to automatically construct knowledge graphs: logistic regression, naive Bayes classifier and a Bayesian network using noisy OR gates. A graph of disease-symptom relationships was elicited from the learned parameters and the constructed knowledge graphs were evaluated and validated, with permission, against Google’s manually-constructed knowledge graph and against expert physician opinions. Our study shows that direct and automated construction of high quality health knowledge graphs from medical records using rudimentary concept extraction is feasible. The noisy OR model produces a high quality knowledge graph reaching precision of 0.85 for a recall of 0.6 in the clinical evaluation. Noisy OR significantly outperforms all tested models across evaluation frameworks (p \\< 0.01).",

    "abstract": "RNA-seq is now the technology of choice for genome-wide differential gene expression experiments, but it is not clear how many biological replicates are needed to ensure valid biological interpretation of the results or which statistical tools are best for analyzing the data. An RNA-seq experiment with 48 biological replicates in each of two conditions was performed to answer these questions and provide guidelines for experimental design. With three biological replicates, nine of the 11 tools evaluated found only 20%–40% of the significantly differentially expressed (SDE) genes identified with the full set of 42 clean replicates. This rises to \\>85% for the subset of SDE genes changing in expression by more than fourfold. To achieve \\>85% for all SDE genes regardless of fold change requires more than 20 biological replicates. The same nine tools successfully control their false discovery rate at ≲5% for all numbers of replicates, while the remaining two tools fail to control their FDR adequately, particularly for low numbers of replicates. For future RNA-seq experiments, these results suggest that at least six biological replicates should be used, rising to at least 12 when it is important to identify SDE genes for all fold changes. If fewer than 12 replicates are used, a superior combination of true positive and false positive performances makes edgeR and DESeq2 the leading tools. For higher replicate numbers, minimizing false positives is more important and DESeq marginally outperforms the other tools.",

    "abstract": "Background High throughput sequencing technology enables the both the human genome and transcriptome to be screened at the single nucleotide resolution. Tools have been developed to infer single nucleotide variants (SNVs) from both DNA and RNA sequencing data. To evaluate how much difference can be expected between DNA and RNA sequencing data, and among tissue sources, we designed a study to examine the single nucleotide difference among five sources of high throughput sequencing data generated from the same individual, including exome sequencing from blood, tumor and adjacent normal tissue, and RNAseq from tumor and adjacent normal tissue.Results Through careful quality control and analysis of the SNVs, we found little difference between DNA-DNA pairs (1%–2%). However, between DNA-RNA pairs, SNV differences ranged anywhere from 10% to 20%.Conclusions Only a small portion of these differences can be explained by RNA editing. Instead, the majority of the DNA-RNA differences should be attributed to technical errors from sequencing and post-processing of RNAseq data. Our analysis results suggest that SNV detection using RNAseq is subject to high false positive rates.Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12864-017-4022-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",

    "abstract": "Conditional independence testing is an important problem, especially in Bayesian network learning and causal discovery. Due to the curse of dimensionality, testing for conditional independence of continuous variables is particularly challenging. We propose a Kernel-based Conditional Independence test (KCI-test), by constructing an appropriate test statistic and deriving its asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis of conditional independence. The proposed method is computationally efficient and easy to implement. Experimental results show that it outperforms other methods, especially when the conditioning set is large or the sample size is not very large, in which case other methods encounter difficulties.",

    "abstract": "We examine the Bayesian approach to the discovery of causal DAG models and compare it to the constraint-based approach. Both approaches rely on the Causal Markov condition, but the two differ significantly in theory and practice. An important difference between the approaches is that the constraint-based approach uses categorical information about conditional-independence constraints in the domain, whereas the Bayesian approach weighs the degree to which such constraints hold. As a result, the Bayesian approach has three distinct advantages over its constraint-based counterpart. One, conclusions derived from the Bayesian approach are not susceptible to incorrect categorical decisions about independence facts that can occur with data sets of finite size. Two, using the Bayesian approach, finer distinctions among model structures—both quantitative and qualitative—can be made. Three, information from several models can be combined to make better inferences and to better account for modeling uncertainty. In addition to describing the general Bayesian approach to causal discovery, we review approximation methods for missing data and hidden variables, and illustrate differences between the Bayesian and constraint-based methods using artificial and real examples.",

    "abstract": "We discuss causal structure learning based on linear structural equation models. Conventional learning methods most often assume Gaussianity and create many indistinguishable models. Therefore, in many cases it is difficult to obtain much information on the structure. Recently, a non-Gaussian learning method called LiNGAM has been proposed to identify the model structure without using prior knowledge on the structure. However, more efficient learning can be achieved if some prior knowledge on a part of the structure is available. In this paper, we propose to use prior knowledge to improve the performance of a state-of-art non-Gaussian method. Experiments on artificial data show that the accuracy and computational time are significantly improved even if the amount of prior knowledge is not so large.",

    "abstract": "We describe a Bayesian approach for learning Bayesian networks from a combination of prior knowledge and statistical data. First and foremost, we develop a methodology for assessing informative priors needed for learning. Our approach is derived from a set of assumptions made previously as well as the assumption oflikelihood equivalence, which says that data should not help to discriminate network structures that represent the same assertions of conditional independence. We show that likelihood equivalence when combined with previously made assumptions implies that the user’s priors for network parameters can be encoded in a single Bayesian network for the next case to be seen—aprior network—and a single measure of confidence for that network. Second, using these priors, we show how to compute the relative posterior probabilities of network structures given data. Third, we describe search methods for identifying network structures with high posterior probabilities. We describe polynomial algorithms for finding the highest-scoring network structures in the special case where every node has at mostk=1 parent. For the general case (k\\>1), which is NP-hard, we review heuristic search algorithms including local search, iterative local search, and simulated annealing. Finally, we describe a methodology for evaluating Bayesian-network learning algorithms, and apply this approach to a comparison of various approaches.",

    "abstract": "Graphical models can represent a multivariate distribution in a convenient and accessible form as a graph. Causal models can be viewed as a special class of graphical models that represent not only the distribution of the observed system but also the distributions under external interventions. They hence enable predictions under hypothetical interventions, which is important for decision making. The challenging task of learning causal models from data always relies on some underlying assumptions.

    "abstract": "We present a very general approach to learning the structure of causal models based on d-separation constraints, obtained from any given set of overlapping passive observational or experimental data sets. The procedure allows for both directed cycles (feedback loops) and the presence of latent variables. Our approach is based on a logical representation of causal pathways, which permits the integration of quite general background knowledge, and inference is performed using a Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solver. The procedure is complete in that it exhausts the available information on whether any given edge can be determined to be present or absent, and returns \"unknown\" otherwise. Many existing constraint-based causal discovery algorithms can be seen as special cases, tailored to circumstances in which one or more restricting assumptions apply. Simulations illustrate the effect of these assumptions on discovery and how the present algorithm scales.",

Building on the so-called low rank plus sparse framework, we suggest a two-stage approach which first removes unwanted variation using latent Gaussian graphical model selection, and then estimates the Markov equivalence class of the underlying DAG by applying GES. This approach is consistent in certain high-dimensional regimes and performs favourably when compared to the state of the art, both in terms of graphical structure recovery and total causal effect estimation.",

    "abstract": "A graphical model is a statistical model that is associated with a graph whose nodes correspond to variables of interest. The edges of the graph reflect allowed conditional dependencies among the variables. Graphical models have computationally convenient factorization properties and have long been a valuable tool for tractable modeling of multivariate distributions. More recently, applications such as reconstructing gene regulatory networks from gene expression data have driven major advances in structure learning, that is, estimating the graph underlying a model. We review some of these advances and discuss methods such as the graphical lasso and neighborhood selection for undirected graphical models (or Markov random fields) and the PC algorithm and score-based search methods for directed graphical models (or Bayesian networks). We further review extensions that account for effects of latent variables and heterogeneous data sources.",

    "abstract": "Observational data recorded in the Electronic Health Record (EHR) can help us better understand the effects of therapeutic agents in routine clinical practice. As such data were not collected for research purposes, their reuse for research must compensate for additional information that may bias analyses and lead to faulty conclusions. Confounding is present when factors aside from the given predictor(s) affect the response of interest. However, these additional factors may not be known at the outset. In this paper, we present a scalable literature-based confounding variable discovery method for biomedical research applications with pharmacovigilance as our use case. We hypothesized that statistical models, adjusted with literature-derived confounders, will more accurately identify causative drug-adverse drug event (ADE) relationships. We evaluated our method with a curated reference standard, and found a pattern of improved performance \\~ 5% in two out of three models for gastrointestinal bleeding (pre-adjusted Area Under Curve ≥ 0.6).",

    "abstract": "We develop estimation for potentially high-dimensional additive structural equation models. A key component of our approach is to decouple order search among the variables from feature or edge selection in a directed acyclic graph encoding the causal structure. We show that the former can be done with nonregularized (restricted) maximum likelihood estimation while the latter can be efficiently addressed using sparse regression techniques. Thus, we substantially simplify the problem of structure search and estimation for an important class of causal models. We establish consistency of the (restricted) maximum likelihood estimator for low- and high-dimensional scenarios, and we also allow for misspecification of the error distribution. Furthermore, we develop an efficient computational algorithm which can deal with many variables, and the new method’s accuracy and performance is illustrated on simulated and real data.",

    "abstract": "What is the difference between a prediction that is made with a causal model and that with a non-causal model? Suppose that we intervene on the predictor variables or change the whole environment. The predictions from a causal model will in general work as well under interventions as for observational data. In contrast, predictions from a non-causal model can potentially be very wrong if we actively intervene on variables. Here, we propose to exploit this invariance of a prediction under a causal model for causal inference: given different experimental settings (e.g. various interventions) we collect all models that do show invariance in their predictive accuracy across settings and interventions. The causal model will be a member of this set of models with high probability. This approach yields valid confidence intervals for the causal relationships in quite general scenarios. We examine the example of structural equation models in more detail and provide sufficient assumptions under which the set of causal predictors becomes identifiable. We further investigate robustness properties of our approach under model misspecification and discuss possible extensions. The empirical properties are studied for various data sets, including large-scale gene perturbation experiments.",

The analysis of such data sets is a challenge that has been object of vigorous research.

One way to objectively test such analysis algorithms is to apply them on computational gene network models for which the mechanisms are completely know.Results: We present a system that generates random artificial gene networks according to well-defined topological and kinetic properties.

    "abstract": "Background Frustrated with the onslaught of articles reporting fascination with results that appear paradoxical but are merely due to selection bias, we studied the apparent effect of obesity on diabetes risk in youth who had a test for diabetes. We hypothesised that obese subjects would have lower rates of diabetes than non-obese subjects due to selection bias, and consequently, obesity would appear to lower the risk of diabetes. Methods Retrospective cohort study of children (4–9 years), pre-teens (10–12 years) and teenagers (13–19 years). Participation was restricted to those who had a test of haemoglobin A1C along with measured height and weight. Body mass index percentile via the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention age and sex standards was calculated and categorised. The main outcome was A1C%, subsequently categorised at the level for diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (≥6.5%). Results The sample consisted of 134 (2%) underweight, 1718 (30%) healthy weight, 660 (12%) overweight and 3190 (56%) obese individuals. 16% (n=936) had an A1C≥6.5%. Overall, healthy weight children had 8.2 times the risk of A1C≥6.5% (95% CI 5.3 to 12.7) compared with those in the obese category. The relative risk was 13 in pre-teens (95% CI 8.5 to 20.0) and 3.9 in teenagers (95% CI 3.3 to 4.7). Conclusions Healthy weight was associated with a 4–13 times higher relative risk of diabetes mellitus compared with being obese. While apparently shocking, the study’s fatal flaw (selection bias) explains the ‘paradoxical’ finding. Ignoring selection bias can delay advances in medical science.",

    "abstract": "Consider the following three important problems in statistical inference, namely, constructing confidence intervals for (1) the error of a high-dimensional (\\$p\\>n\\$) regression estimator, (2) the linear regression noise level, and (3) the genetic signal-to-noise ratio of a continuous-valued trait (related to the heritability). All three problems turn out to be closely related to the little-studied problem of performing inference on the \\$\\\\ell\\_2\\$-norm of the signal in high-dimensional linear regression. We derive a novel procedure for this, which is asymptotically correct when the covariates are multivariate Gaussian and produces valid confidence intervals in finite samples as well. The procedure, called EigenPrism, is computationally fast and makes no assumptions on coefficient sparsity or knowledge of the noise level. We investigate the width of the EigenPrism confidence intervals, including a comparison with a Bayesian setting in which our interval is just 5% wider than the Bayes credible interval. We are then able to unify the three aforementioned problems by showing that the EigenPrism procedure with only minor modifications is able to make important contributions to all three. We also investigate the robustness of coverage and find that the method applies in practice and in finite samples much more widely than just the case of multivariate Gaussian covariates. Finally, we apply EigenPrism to a genetic dataset to estimate the genetic signal-to-noise ratio for a number of continuous phenotypes.",

The proposed method facilitates confounder selection in high-dimensional settings. We show that under regularity conditions our method attains the oracle property. The selected variables are used to form a doubly robust regression estimator of the treatment effect. We show that under some conditions our method attains the oracle property.

    "abstract": "Summary The three-dimensional configuration of DNA is integral to all nuclear processes in eukaryotes, yet our knowledge of the chromosome architecture is still limited. Genome-wide chromosome conformation capture studies have uncovered features of chromatin organization in cultured cells, but genome architecture in human tissues has yet to be explored. Here, we report the most comprehensive survey to date of chromatin organization in human tissues. Through integrative analysis of chromatin contact maps in 21 primary human tissues and cell types, we find topologically associating domains highly conserved in different tissues. We also discover genomic regions that exhibit unusually high levels of local chromatin interactions. These frequently interacting regions (FIREs) are enriched for super-enhancers and are near tissue-specifically expressed genes. They display strong tissue-specificity in local chromatin interactions. Additionally, FIRE formation is partially dependent on CTCF and the Cohesin complex. We further show that FIREs can help annotate the function of non-coding sequence variants.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression profiling of in vitro drug perturbations is useful for many biomedical discovery applications including drug repurposing and elucidation of drug mechanisms. However, limited data availability across cell types has hindered our capacity to leverage or explore the cell-specificity of these perturbations. While recent efforts have generated a large number of drug perturbation profiles across a variety of human cell types, many gaps remain in this combinatorial drug-cell space. Hence, we asked whether it is possible to fill these gaps by predicting cell-specific drug perturbation profiles using available expression data from related conditions–i.e. from other drugs and cell types. We developed a computational framework that first arranges existing profiles into a three-dimensional array (or tensor) indexed by drugs, genes, and cell types, and then uses either local (nearest-neighbors) or global (tensor completion) information to predict unmeasured profiles. We evaluate prediction accuracy using a variety of metrics, and find that the two methods have complementary performance, each superior in different regions in the drug-cell space. Predictions achieve correlations of 0.68 with true values, and maintain accurate differentially expressed genes (AUC 0.81). Finally, we demonstrate that the predicted profiles add value for making downstream associations with drug targets and therapeutic classes.",

    "abstract": "The Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) is an NIH Common Fund program that catalogs how human cells globally respond to chemical, genetic, and disease perturbations. Resources generated by LINCS include experimental and computational methods, visualization tools, molecular and imaging data, and signatures. By assembling an integrated picture of the range of responses of human cells exposed to many perturbations, the LINCS program aims to better understand human disease and to advance the development of new therapies. Perturbations under study include drugs, genetic perturbations, tissue micro-environments, antibodies, and disease-causing mutations. Responses to perturbations are measured by transcript profiling, mass spectrometry, cell imaging, and biochemical methods, among other assays. The LINCS program focuses on cellular physiology shared among tissues and cell types relevant to an array of diseases, including cancer, heart disease, and neurodegenerative disorders. This Perspective describes LINCS technologies, datasets, tools, and approaches to data accessibility and reusability.",

    "abstract": "We previously piloted the concept of a Connectivity Map (CMap), whereby genes, drugs, and disease states are connected by virtue of common gene-expression signatures. Here, we report more than a 1,000-fold scale-up of the CMap as part of the NIH LINCS Consortium, made possible by a new, low-cost, high-throughput reduced representation expression profiling method that we term L1000. We show that L1000 is highly reproducible, comparable to RNA sequencing, and suitable for computational inference of the expression levels of 81% of non-measured transcripts. We further show that the expanded CMap can be used to discover mechanism of action of small molecules, functionally annotate genetic variants of disease genes, and inform clinical trials. The 1.3 million L1000 profiles described here, as well as tools for their analysis, are available at https://clue.io.",

    "abstract": "Summary The three-dimensional configuration of DNA is integral to all nuclear processes in eukaryotes, yet our knowledge of the chromosome architecture is still limited. Genome-wide chromosome conformation capture studies have uncovered features of chromatin organization in cultured cells, but genome architecture in human tissues has yet to be explored. Here, we report the most comprehensive survey to date of chromatin organization in human tissues. Through integrative analysis of chromatin contact maps in 21 primary human tissues and cell types, we find topologically associating domains highly conserved in different tissues. We also discover genomic regions that exhibit unusually high levels of local chromatin interactions. These frequently interacting regions (FIREs) are enriched for super-enhancers and are near tissue-specifically expressed genes. They display strong tissue-specificity in local chromatin interactions. Additionally, FIRE formation is partially dependent on CTCF and the Cohesin complex. We further show that FIREs can help annotate the function of non-coding sequence variants.",

    "abstract": "Author Summary Genomic survey of microbes by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomics has inspired appreciation for the role of complex communities in diverse ecosystems. However, due to the unique properties of community composition data, standard data analysis tools are likely to produce statistical artifacts. For a typical experiment studying microbial ecosystems these artifacts can lead to erroneous conclusions about patterns of associations between microbial taxa. We developed a new procedure that seeks to infer ecological associations between microbial populations, by 1) taking advantage of the proportionality invariance of relative abundance data and 2) making assumptions about the underlying network structure when the number of taxa in the dataset is larger than the number of sampled communities. Additionally, we employed a novel tool to generate biologically plausible synthetic data and objectively benchmark current association inference tools. Finally, we tested our procedures on a large-scale 16S rRNA gene sequencing dataset sampled from the human gut.",

    "abstract": "One of the principal mechanisms by which cells differentiate and respond to changes in external signals or conditions is by changing the activity levels of transcription factors (TFs). This changes the transcription rates of target genes via the cell’s TF network, which ultimately contributes to reconfiguring cellular state. Since microarrays provided our first window into global cellular state, computational biologists have eagerly attacked the problem of mapping TF networks, a key part of the cell’s control circuitry. In retrospect, however, steady-state mRNA abundance levels were a poor substitute for TF activity levels and gene transcription rates. Likewise, mapping TF binding through chromatin immunoprecipitation proved less predictive of functional regulation and less amenable to systematic elucidation of complete networks than originally hoped. This review explains these roadblocks and the current, unprecedented blossoming of new experimental techniques built on second generation sequencing, which hold out the promise of rapid progress in TF network mapping.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic modelling is one of the cornerstones of systems biology. Many research efforts are currently being invested in the development and exploitation of large-scale kinetic models. The associated problems of parameter estimation (model calibration) and optimal experimental design are particularly challenging. The community has already developed many methods and software packages which aim to facilitate these tasks. However, there is a lack of suitable benchmark problems which allow a fair and systematic evaluation and comparison of these contributions.",

The package allows various options for delay parameters and can easily included in reactions for promoter delay, RNA delay and Protein delay. A user can tune these parameters to model various types of reactions within a cell. As examples, we present two network models to generate expression profiles. We also demonstrated the inference of networks and the evaluation of association measure of edge and non-edge components from the generated expression profiles.",

    "abstract": "Network models are widely used to describe complex signaling systems. Cellular wiring varies in different cellular contexts and numerous inference techniques have been developed to infer the structure of a network from experimental data of the network’s behavior. To objectively identify which inference strategy is best suited to a specific network, a gold standard network and dataset are required. However, suitable datasets for benchmarking are difficult to find. Numerous tools exist that can simulate data for transcriptional networks, but these are of limited use for the study of signaling networks. Here, we describe SiGNet (Signal Generator for Networks): a Cytoscape app that simulates experimental data for a signaling network of known structure. SiGNet has been developed and tested against published experimental data, incorporating information on network architecture, and the directionality and strength of interactions to create biological data in silico. SiGNet is the first tool to simulate biological signaling data, enabling an accurate and systematic assessment of inference strategies. SiGNet can also be used to produce preliminary models of key biological pathways following perturbation.",

    "abstract": "There is intense interest in applying machine learning to problems of causal inference in fields such as healthcare, economics and education. In particular, individual-level causal inference has important applications such as precision medicine. We give a new theoretical analysis and family of algorithms for predicting individual treatment effect (ITE) from observational data, under the assumption known as strong ignorability. The algorithms learn a \"balanced\" representation such that the induced treated and control distributions look similar. We give a novel, simple and intuitive generalization-error bound showing that the expected ITE estimation error of a representation is bounded by a sum of the standard generalization-error of that representation and the distance between the treated and control distributions induced by the representation. We use Integral Probability Metrics to measure distances between distributions, deriving explicit bounds for the Wasserstein and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) distances. Experiments on real and simulated data show the new algorithms match or outperform the state-of-the-art.",

    "abstract": "We consider structural equation models in which variables can be written as a function of their parents and noise terms, which are assumed to be jointly independent. Corresponding to each structural equation model, there is a directed acyclic graph describing the relationships between the variables. In Gaussian structural equation models with linear functions, the graph can be identified from the joint distribution only up to Markov equivalence classes, assuming faithfulness. In this work, we prove full identifiability if all noise variables have the same variances: the directed acyclic graph can be recovered from the joint Gaussian distribution. Our result has direct implications for causal inference: if the data follow a Gaussian structural equation model with equal error variances and assuming that all variables are observed, the causal structure can be inferred from observational data only. We propose a statistical method and an algorithm that exploit our theoretical findings.",

    "abstract": "Due to the presence of systematic measurement biases, data normalization is an essential preprocessing step in the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. While a variety of normalization procedures are available for bulk RNA-seq, their suitability with respect to single-cell data is still largely unexplored. Furthermore, there may be multiple, competing considerations behind the assessment of normalization performance, some of them study-specific. The choice of normalization method can have a large impact on the results of downstream analyses (e.g., clustering, inference of cell lineages, differential expression analysis), and thus it is critically important to assess the performance of competing methods in order to select a suitable procedure for the study at hand. We have developed scone - a framework that implements a wide range of normalization procedures in the context of scRNA-seq, and enables the assessment of their performance based on a comprehensive set of data-driven performance metrics. The accompanying open-source Bioconductor R software package scone (available at https://bioconductor.org/packages/scone) also provides numerical and graphical summaries of expression measures, data quality assessment, and data-adaptive gene and sample filtering criteria. We demonstrate the effectiveness of scone on a selection of scRNA-seq datasets across a variety of protocols, ranging from plate- to droplet-based methods. We show that scone is able to correctly rank normalization methods according to their performance in a given dataset and that selecting the best performing normalization leads to higher agreement with independent validation data than lowly-ranked methods.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we propose methods for estimating heterogeneity in causal effects in experimental and observational studies and for conducting hypothesis tests about the magnitude of differences in treatment effects across subsets of the population. We provide a data-driven approach to partition the data into subpopulations that differ in the magnitude of their treatment effects. The approach enables the construction of valid confidence intervals for treatment effects, even with many covariates relative to the sample size, and without “sparsity” assumptions. We propose an “honest” approach to estimation, whereby one sample is used to construct the partition and another to estimate treatment effects for each subpopulation. Our approach builds on regression tree methods, modified to optimize for goodness of fit in treatment effects and to account for honest estimation. Our model selection criterion anticipates that bias will be eliminated by honest estimation and also accounts for the effect of making additional splits on the variance of treatment effect estimates within each subpopulation. We address the challenge that the “ground truth” for a causal effect is not observed for any individual unit, so that standard approaches to cross-validation must be modified. Through a simulation study, we show that for our preferred method honest estimation results in nominal coverage for 90% confidence intervals, whereas coverage ranges between 74% and 84% for nonhonest approaches. Honest estimation requires estimating the model with a smaller sample size; the cost in terms of mean squared error of treatment effects for our preferred method ranges between 7–22%.",

    "abstract": "Many scientific and engineering challenges – ranging from personalized medicine to customized marketing recommendations – require an understanding of treatment effect heterogeneity. In this paper, we develop a non-parametric causal forest for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects that extends Breiman’s widely used random forest algorithm. In the potential outcomes framework with unconfoundedness, we show that causal forests are pointwise consistent for the true treatment effect, and have an asymptotically Gaussian and centered sampling distribution. We also discuss a practical method for constructing asymptotic confidence intervals for the true treatment effect that are centered at the causal forest estimates. Our theoretical results rely on a generic Gaussian theory for a large family of random forest algorithms. To our knowledge, this is the first set of results that allows any type of random forest, including classification and regression forests, to be used for provably valid statistical inference. In experiments, we find causal forests to be substantially more powerful than classical methods based on nearest-neighbor matching, especially in the presence of irrelevant covariates.",

    "abstract": "Demand for clinical decision support systems in medicine and self-diagnostic symptom checkers has substantially increased in recent years. Existing platforms rely on knowledge bases manually compiled through a labor-intensive process or automatically derived using simple pairwise statistics. This study explored an automated process to learn high quality knowledge bases linking diseases and symptoms directly from electronic medical records. Medical concepts were extracted from 273,174 de-identified patient records and maximum likelihood estimation of three probabilistic models was used to automatically construct knowledge graphs: logistic regression, naive Bayes classifier and a Bayesian network using noisy OR gates. A graph of disease-symptom relationships was elicited from the learned parameters and the constructed knowledge graphs were evaluated and validated, with permission, against Google’s manually-constructed knowledge graph and against expert physician opinions. Our study shows that direct and automated construction of high quality health knowledge graphs from medical records using rudimentary concept extraction is feasible. The noisy OR model produces a high quality knowledge graph reaching precision of 0.85 for a recall of 0.6 in the clinical evaluation. Noisy OR significantly outperforms all tested models across evaluation frameworks (p \\< 0.01).",

    "abstract": "Conditional independence testing is an important problem, especially in Bayesian network learning and causal discovery. Due to the curse of dimensionality, testing for conditional independence of continuous variables is particularly challenging. We propose a Kernel-based Conditional Independence test (KCI-test), by constructing an appropriate test statistic and deriving its asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis of conditional independence. The proposed method is computationally efficient and easy to implement. Experimental results show that it outperforms other methods, especially when the conditioning set is large or the sample size is not very large, in which case other methods encounter difficulties.",

    "abstract": "RNA-seq is now the technology of choice for genome-wide differential gene expression experiments, but it is not clear how many biological replicates are needed to ensure valid biological interpretation of the results or which statistical tools are best for analyzing the data. An RNA-seq experiment with 48 biological replicates in each of two conditions was performed to answer these questions and provide guidelines for experimental design. With three biological replicates, nine of the 11 tools evaluated found only 20%–40% of the significantly differentially expressed (SDE) genes identified with the full set of 42 clean replicates. This rises to \\>85% for the subset of SDE genes changing in expression by more than fourfold. To achieve \\>85% for all SDE genes regardless of fold change requires more than 20 biological replicates. The same nine tools successfully control their false discovery rate at ≲5% for all numbers of replicates, while the remaining two tools fail to control their FDR adequately, particularly for low numbers of replicates. For future RNA-seq experiments, these results suggest that at least six biological replicates should be used, rising to at least 12 when it is important to identify SDE genes for all fold changes. If fewer than 12 replicates are used, a superior combination of true positive and false positive performances makes edgeR and DESeq2 the leading tools. For higher replicate numbers, minimizing false positives is more important and DESeq marginally outperforms the other tools.",

    "abstract": "Background High throughput sequencing technology enables the both the human genome and transcriptome to be screened at the single nucleotide resolution. Tools have been developed to infer single nucleotide variants (SNVs) from both DNA and RNA sequencing data. To evaluate how much difference can be expected between DNA and RNA sequencing data, and among tissue sources, we designed a study to examine the single nucleotide difference among five sources of high throughput sequencing data generated from the same individual, including exome sequencing from blood, tumor and adjacent normal tissue, and RNAseq from tumor and adjacent normal tissue.Results Through careful quality control and analysis of the SNVs, we found little difference between DNA-DNA pairs (1%–2%). However, between DNA-RNA pairs, SNV differences ranged anywhere from 10% to 20%.Conclusions Only a small portion of these differences can be explained by RNA editing. Instead, the majority of the DNA-RNA differences should be attributed to technical errors from sequencing and post-processing of RNAseq data. Our analysis results suggest that SNV detection using RNAseq is subject to high false positive rates.Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12864-017-4022-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",

    "abstract": "We examine the Bayesian approach to the discovery of causal DAG models and compare it to the constraint-based approach. Both approaches rely on the Causal Markov condition, but the two differ significantly in theory and practice. An important difference between the approaches is that the constraint-based approach uses categorical information about conditional-independence constraints in the domain, whereas the Bayesian approach weighs the degree to which such constraints hold. As a result, the Bayesian approach has three distinct advantages over its constraint-based counterpart. One, conclusions derived from the Bayesian approach are not susceptible to incorrect categorical decisions about independence facts that can occur with data sets of finite size. Two, using the Bayesian approach, finer distinctions among model structures—both quantitative and qualitative—can be made. Three, information from several models can be combined to make better inferences and to better account for modeling uncertainty. In addition to describing the general Bayesian approach to causal discovery, we review approximation methods for missing data and hidden variables, and illustrate differences between the Bayesian and constraint-based methods using artificial and real examples.",

    "abstract": "We discuss causal structure learning based on linear structural equation models. Conventional learning methods most often assume Gaussianity and create many indistinguishable models. Therefore, in many cases it is difficult to obtain much information on the structure. Recently, a non-Gaussian learning method called LiNGAM has been proposed to identify the model structure without using prior knowledge on the structure. However, more efficient learning can be achieved if some prior knowledge on a part of the structure is available. In this paper, we propose to use prior knowledge to improve the performance of a state-of-art non-Gaussian method. Experiments on artificial data show that the accuracy and computational time are significantly improved even if the amount of prior knowledge is not so large.",

    "abstract": "We describe a Bayesian approach for learning Bayesian networks from a combination of prior knowledge and statistical data. First and foremost, we develop a methodology for assessing informative priors needed for learning. Our approach is derived from a set of assumptions made previously as well as the assumption oflikelihood equivalence, which says that data should not help to discriminate network structures that represent the same assertions of conditional independence. We show that likelihood equivalence when combined with previously made assumptions implies that the user’s priors for network parameters can be encoded in a single Bayesian network for the next case to be seen—aprior network—and a single measure of confidence for that network. Second, using these priors, we show how to compute the relative posterior probabilities of network structures given data. Third, we describe search methods for identifying network structures with high posterior probabilities. We describe polynomial algorithms for finding the highest-scoring network structures in the special case where every node has at mostk=1 parent. For the general case (k\\>1), which is NP-hard, we review heuristic search algorithms including local search, iterative local search, and simulated annealing. Finally, we describe a methodology for evaluating Bayesian-network learning algorithms, and apply this approach to a comparison of various approaches.",

    "abstract": "We present a very general approach to learning the structure of causal models based on d-separation constraints, obtained from any given set of overlapping passive observational or experimental data sets. The procedure allows for both directed cycles (feedback loops) and the presence of latent variables. Our approach is based on a logical representation of causal pathways, which permits the integration of quite general background knowledge, and inference is performed using a Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solver. The procedure is complete in that it exhausts the available information on whether any given edge can be determined to be present or absent, and returns \"unknown\" otherwise. Many existing constraint-based causal discovery algorithms can be seen as special cases, tailored to circumstances in which one or more restricting assumptions apply. Simulations illustrate the effect of these assumptions on discovery and how the present algorithm scales.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a new method to estimate the Markov equivalence class of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) in the presence of hidden variables, in settings where the underlying DAG among the observed variables is sparse, and there are a few hidden variables that have a direct effect on many of the observed ones. Building on the so-called low rank plus sparse framework, we suggest a two-stage approach which first removes unwanted variation using latent Gaussian graphical model selection, and then estimates the Markov equivalence class of the underlying DAG by applying GES. This approach is consistent in certain high-dimensional regimes and performs favourably when compared to the state of the art, both in terms of graphical structure recovery and total causal effect estimation.",

    "abstract": "A graphical model is a statistical model that is associated with a graph whose nodes correspond to variables of interest. The edges of the graph reflect allowed conditional dependencies among the variables. Graphical models have computationally convenient factorization properties and have long been a valuable tool for tractable modeling of multivariate distributions. More recently, applications such as reconstructing gene regulatory networks from gene expression data have driven major advances in structure learning, that is, estimating the graph underlying a model. We review some of these advances and discuss methods such as the graphical lasso and neighborhood selection for undirected graphical models (or Markov random fields) and the PC algorithm and score-based search methods for directed graphical models (or Bayesian networks). We further review extensions that account for effects of latent variables and heterogeneous data sources.",

    "abstract": "Observational data recorded in the Electronic Health Record (EHR) can help us better understand the effects of therapeutic agents in routine clinical practice. As such data were not collected for research purposes, their reuse for research must compensate for additional information that may bias analyses and lead to faulty conclusions. Confounding is present when factors aside from the given predictor(s) affect the response of interest. However, these additional factors may not be known at the outset. In this paper, we present a scalable literature-based confounding variable discovery method for biomedical research applications with pharmacovigilance as our use case. We hypothesized that statistical models, adjusted with literature-derived confounders, will more accurately identify causative drug-adverse drug event (ADE) relationships. We evaluated our method with a curated reference standard, and found a pattern of improved performance \\~ 5% in two out of three models for gastrointestinal bleeding (pre-adjusted Area Under Curve ≥ 0.6).",

    "abstract": "We consider the estimation of joint causal effects from observational data. In particular, we propose new methods to estimate the effect of multiple simultaneous interventions (e.g., multiple gene knockouts), under the assumption that the observational data come from an unknown linear structural equation model with independent errors. We derive asymptotic variances of our estimators when the underlying causal structure is partly known, as well as high-dimensional consistency when the causal structure is fully unknown and the joint distribution is multivariate Gaussian. We also propose a generalization of our methodology to the class of nonparanormal distributions. We evaluate the estimators in simulation studies and also illustrate them on data from the DREAM4 challenge.",
