Formally speaking, $X$ and $Y$ are dependent, i.e. they share some information, if their joint distribution is not the same as the product of their marginals : $X \indep Y \Leftrightarrow p(X,Y) \not= p(X)p(Y)$. Only a few measures can measure dependency according to this strict equivalence : Pearson correlation of course detects only linear relationships, it is generalized by the distance correlation for all distributions with finite first moments.</description></item></channel></rss>
