Several decades of research later, and almost as many different estimators as there were applications, it may come as a surprise that many basic questions remain unanswered (although recent progress has been made, especially in the continuous case). To understand why, recall that mutual information $\II(X;Y)$ is defined for $X$ and $Y$ of any dimensions.</description></item><item><title>Mutual information with mixed variables</title><link>https://vcabe.li/posts/mi_with_mixed_variables/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vcabe.li/posts/mi_with_mixed_variables/</guid><description>In many real-life datasets, particularly in medical records of patients, we might encounter both discrete and continuous variables and want to measure their interactions, without favoring one type of variable or the other. In other words, the dependency measure should scale with the signal-to-noise ratio the same way for continuous-continuous, discrete-discrete or discrete-continuous combinations. In the context of constraint-based approaches, another layer of difficulty is added as the same applies for the variables of the conditioning set.</description></item><item><title>Introduction to information theoretic measures</title><link>https://vcabe.li/posts/intro_to_info_theory/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vcabe.li/posts/intro_to_info_theory/</guid><description>How do you measure the dependency between two variables ? Formally speaking, $X$ and $Y$ are dependent, i.e. they share some information, if their joint distribution is not the same as the product of their marginals : $X \indep Y \Leftrightarrow p(X,Y) \not= p(X)p(Y)$. Only a few measures can measure dependency according to this strict equivalence : Pearson correlation of course detects only linear relationships, it is generalized by the distance correlation for all distributions with finite first moments.</description></item></channel></rss>
