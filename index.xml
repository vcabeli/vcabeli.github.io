In other words, the dependency measure should scale with the signal-to-noise ratio the same way for continuous-continuous, discrete-discrete or discrete-continuous combinations. In the context of constraint-based approaches, another layer of difficulty is added as the same applies for the variables of the conditioning set.</description></item><item><title>Introduction to information theoretic measures</title><link>https://vcabe.li/posts/intro_to_info_theory/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vcabe.li/posts/intro_to_info_theory/</guid><description>How do you measure the dependency between two variables ? Formally speaking, $X$ and $Y$ are dependent, i.e. they share some information, if their joint distribution is not the same as the product of their marginals : $X \indep Y \Leftrightarrow p(X,Y) \not= p(X)p(Y)$. Only a few measures can measure dependency according to this strict equivalence : Pearson correlation of course detects only linear relationships, it is generalized by the distance correlation for all distributions with finite first moments.</description></item></channel></rss>
